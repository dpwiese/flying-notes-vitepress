![Piper Archer III PA-28-181 G1000 NXi.](/img/archer/archer-nxi.jpeg){width=800}

## Primary Flight Controls

* Stabilator
* Rudder
* Ailerons
  * Differential
* Cables between the controls and the surfaces
* Balance weights on control surfaces prevent flutter of the control surfaces in flight
  * See [FAA-H-8083-31B Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook - Airframe](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-31B_Aviation_Maintenance_Technician_Handbook.pdf) page 4-88:

    > As a general rule, repair the control surface in such a manner that the weight distribution is not affected in any way, in order to preclude the occurrence of flutter of the control surface in flight. Under certain conditions, counterbalance weight is added forward of the hinge line to maintain balance. Add or remove balance weights only when necessary in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Flight testing must be accomplished to ensure flutter is not a problem. Failure to check and retain control surface balance within the original or maximum allowable value could result in a serious flight hazard.

## Secondary Flight Controls

::: info NOTE
While the right flap can be used as a step while in the up position, it's generally advisable to avoid doing so if it is safe to prevent damaging the attachment bracket, which can break from the weight of a person.
:::

* Flaps
  * Slotted type
  * Mechanically actuated with spring to return to up position
  * See POH (VB-2749) page 7-5:

    > A past-center lock incorporated in the actuating linkage holds the flap when it is in the up position so that it may be used as a step on the right side. The flap will only support a step load in the full up position.

* Trim
  * Stabilator
  * Rudder
* Stabilator trim is an anti-servo tab, moving in the same direction as the stabilator to increase control pressure

![Archer slotted flaps. Note the hinge point offset below the flap surface creates the slot when the flaps are deflected.](/img/archer/archer-flaps.jpeg){width=600}

### Cooling System

* Air cooled
* Air flows into the inlets behind the prop, over the engine, and exits out the bottom
* Circulating oil (along with the oil cooler) aids in cooling

### Exhaust System

![Archer Airplane Maintenance Manual (PN 761-883) 78-00-00 Page 1 Figure 1 exhaust system. Annotations removed for clarity.](/img/archer-amm/archer-amm-78-00-00-page-1-figure-1-exhaust-system.png){width=800 border=true}

### Ignition System

* Archer Airplane Maintenance Manual (PN 761-883) 71-00-00 page 2:

    > The ARCHER III is equipped with two Slick 4373 magnetos. These magnetos are engineered to give trouble free ignition, are completely self contained, and have an impulse coupling to aid in starting.

### Induction System

* Note as described in the [Fuel System](/aircraft/archer-nxi/systems#fuel-system) section below that fuel is injected into the cylinder head intake ports.

### Propeller

![Archer Sensenich propeller.](/img/archer/archer-prop-sensenich-logo.jpeg){width=400}

* 2-bladed
* Fixed-pitch
* Sensenich
* Model 76EM8S14-0-62
* Aluminum
* 76 inch diameter

## Fuel System

* 50 gallons total capacity
* 48 gallons usable
  * 24 gallons usable per side
* Engine driven and electric fuel pump
* Archer Airplane Maintenance Manual (PN 761-883) 71-00-00 page 1:

    > The fuel injection system is a conventional, Bendix-type RSA5 system, consisting of a fuel injection servo that meters fuel delivery based on engine intake airflow, a flow divider that evenly distributes fuel to the 4 cylinders and injection nozzles that direct vaporized fuel into the cylinder head intake ports. An alternate air control is provided in the event of blockage of the primary, filtered airflow path to the engine. The design of the system will also continue to provide the required, minimum heat rise to prevent or eliminate icing of the system by pulling airflow from around the exhaust tailpipe.

![Archer Airplane Maintenance Manual (PN 761-883) 78-00-00 Page 3 fuel system.](/img/archer-amm/archer-amm-28-00-00-page-3-fuel-system.png){width=800 border=true}

## Oil System

* Wet sump
* Capacity: 8 quarts
* Minimum safe quantity: 2 quarts

## Electrical

* 70 ampere alternator
* 28 volt electrical system
* 24 volt primary battery
* Single external power connector
* Isolated 24 volt emergency battery

* POH Page 7-49:

    > When energized by the battery master switch the primary battery supplies electrical power to the starter, as well as all items on the Essential Bus, Non-Essential Bus and Lighting Bus.

    > The emergency battery provides electrical power to the emergency bus in the unlikely event of a complete electrical failure. With the EMERG BATT switch in the ARM position, power is applied to the emergency bus automatically if electrical power is removed from the primary electrical system. Functions available via the emergency bus include all standby instrument functions, PFD functions (nav/com #1 only), and the audio panel. The emergency battery is sized to provide a minimum duration of 30 minutes of electrical power to the emergency bus equipment.

* `ALTR AMPS`
  * Positive means the alternator is providing current *to the system*
  * This is expected and normal while the engine is running
* `BATT AMPS`
  * Negative means the battery is providing current *to the system*
  * This is normal when the electrical system is on but the engine is not running
  * This is *abnormal* when the engine is running as it indicates the battery is discharging

* Archer Airplane Maintenance Manual (PN 761-883) 71-00-00 page 2:

    > In addition to the previously mentioned components, each ARCHER III engine is furnished with a starter, 70 ampere alternator, 28 volt electrical system, shielded ignition, and fuel pump.

* Voltage regulator see POH (VB-2749) page 7-49:

    > A solid state voltage regulator is located just forward of the instrument panel on the left side of the aircraft. The voltage regulator is designed to regulate the electrical system bus voltage to 28 volts and to prevent damage to the electrical and avionics equipment by removing the alternator from the circuit if its output exceeds 32 volts. In this situation an ALTR FAIL warning CAS message will illuminate.

## Hydraulic System

![Piper Archer III NXi brakes.](/img/archer/archer-brakes.jpeg){width=600}

* Piper Archer has a separate master cylinder for the handbrake, see POH (VB-2749) page 7-7:

    > The toe and hand brakes have their own master brake cylinders, but they share a common reservoir.

* Aspen Avionics Evolution Backup Display (EBD) provides backup attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and VSI
* The POH (VB-2749) page 2-15 states that the [Evolution Backup Display Pilot's Guide (091-00027-001)](https://aspenavionics.com/documents/091-00027-001%20A%20EBD%20Pilots%20Guide%20Final%20for%20web.pdf) is the correct supplement for the EBD

* Archer Airplane Maintenance Manual (PN 761-883) 34-24-00 page 1:

    > The Aspen Avionics Evolution Backup Display (EBD) system provides a standby display for the primary IFDS system. The EBD contains an internal ADAHRS that is used to provide attitude and heading data for the display. The EBD as installed by Piper is connected to the emergency power buss and is powered by the emergencey battery to provide a minimum of 30 minute operation in the event of power loss under all foreseeable operating conditions. In addition, the EBD contains an internal battery which will provide an additional nominal 30 minute operation in the event emergency battery exhaustion.

* Remote Sensor Module (RSM)
  * Located on the underside of the right wing
* The RSM contains the following sub-systems:
  * 3D magnetic flux (heading) sensors
  * Outside Air Temperature (OAT) sensor
  * Emergency backup GPS engine and antenna
