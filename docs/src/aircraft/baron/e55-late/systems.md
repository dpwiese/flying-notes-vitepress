## Powerplant and Propellers

* **==Engine Overview (CHAND)==**
  * ==**C** - Continental IO-520-C==
    * Fuel injected
    * Six-cylinder
    * Rated at 285 horsepower at 2700 rpm
  * ==**H** - Horizontally opposed==
  * ==**A** - Air cooled==
  * ==**N** - Naturally aspirated==
  * ==**D** - Direct-drive==
* Engine lubrication and cooling
  * 12 quart oil capacity (page 7-25)
  * No published minimum oil, Company policy is 9
  * Minimum
  * Has thermostat to control flow through oil coolers
  * Oil type is SAE 50 (above 40 &#176;C) or SAE 30 (below 40 &#176;C)
  * Cowl flaps manually actuated
* The starter is located on the rear of the engine
* **Induction System**
  * N322ET induction system draws air through the ram inlets and draws it through a filter
  * Some Barons have an induction selector that allows for selection of filtered or unfiltered ram air

![E55 Baron (N322ET) oil level](/img/e55-baron-n322et/e55-baron-n322et-oil-level.jpeg){width=480}

* **Propeller system**
  * ==3-bladed==
    * Hartzell
    * P/N: PHC-C3YF-2UF
    * 76 inch diameter
  * ==Variable pitch==
  * ==Constant speed==
  * ==Full-feathering==
  * Forces moving prop to feather (high pitch)
    * ==Springs==
    * ==Counterweights==
    * ==Air charge==
      * The air charge is not explicitly mentioned in the POH, but is in the prop guide for the propeller
  * ==Engine oil under governor-boosted pressure moves the blades to low pitch==
  * ==Has unfeathering accumulators==
    * Gas-assisted pressure to drive oil back into the propeller dome to get the propeller on a stopped engine (that isn't producing oil pressure) out of feather
    * Unfeathering accumulator like a balloon, when oil pump is going its blowing up the balloon
    * Feather is pinching the balloon closed
  * In prop big spring with nitrogen charge inside to push oil out
  * Counterweights on prop to drive prop to feather
  * POH page 7-20

* Gear
  * Three gear down lights, one for each gear
  * Gear lights dim when nav lights are on
  * All three up switches in series = one red light?
  * Gear extended closes the squat switch
  * Gear has warning horn

## Fuel, Oil, and Hydraulic

### Fuel System

* ==Fuel capacity 172 gallons total, 166 gallons usable==
* 4 sumps per side
  * 1 for inboard cell, 1 for box cell, 1 for base of fuel line, 1 for strainer
* Fuel always returns to the tank on the same side as the engine
* Float type fuel sensors
* *Note: in N322ET the fuel flow on right engine is a bit less than left when mixture handles are full rich*

## Pitot Static, Vacuum/Pressure, and Associated Instruments

* One pitot tube on the nose
* Two static ports on left and right aft fuselage
* ==There is a positive pressure system that powers the standby attitude indicator==
  * Two engine-drive dry-pressure pumps
  * If one pump fails, check valve seals it off and other one powers system

## Environmental

![E55 Baron (N322ET) environmental schematic](/img/e55-baron-poh-n322et/e55-baron-poh-page-7-32-environmental-schematic.png){width=480}

* Air Conditioner
  * Controlled by Sofie dial
    * Off
    * Fan
    * Gnd
    * Med
    * High
  * If you just want fan only need one alternator
  * To turn on AC need both alternators on
  * To get AC on ground need at 1000 RPM on both engines to supply enough power
  * If it overheats it will shut itself off automatically
  * Intake for AC condensor under fuselage
* There is vent on left rear fuselage to let air out of cabin
* Heater
  * Cabin heat controls temperature
  * Cabin air controls amount of airflow
    * Reducing cabin airflow allows for warmer air, but reduction below half turns off the heater
    * Pilot air controls airflow to the back seats via vents below the front seats
  * Blower only works on the ground

## Deicing and anti-icing

* Prop and windscreen anti-icing
