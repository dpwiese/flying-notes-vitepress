# E55 Baron (Early) Maneuvers

This document provides maneuvers guidelines developed for Baron N3622A.

## Notes

* Always reach over the bar to access e.g. flaps and gear handle
  * This keeps hand closer to throttles in case an engine quits and we need to run "The Drill"
* Use more complete grip on throttle levers, not just fingers
* =="The Drill": Flaps up first *then* gear up==
* Engine failure below 3,000' AGL, secure the engine come back and land
  * Above 3,000' AGL, can attempt a restart
* CGUMPS
  * Cowl flaps: closed
  * Gas: fuel selectors on mains
  * Undercarriage: gear down
  * Mixture: full rich
  * Props: leave at 2500 RPM to prevent overspeed
  * Switches and seatbelts
    * Landing light on
    * Buckled in
* As part of descent checklist, switch back to mains

## The Drill

* When encountering the "feather" step, also make sure to pull mixture to idle-cutoff

## Engine failure during takeoff before VR

* $V_{\text{MC}}$ is 80 KIAS and $V_{\text{R}}$ is 84 KIAS, so an engine failure before $V_{\text{MC}}$ we are still on the ground
* Guidance in AFM is to simulate the failure at a speed of no more than 50 percent $V_{\text{MC}}$ so 40 KIAS
* ==Throttles to idle==
* ==Maintain directional control==
* ==Brake straight ahead==

## Normal takeoff

* Flaps up
* Hold brakes
* Throttles full
* Gauges green
* Rotate $V_{\text{R}}$ 84 KIAS
* Positive rate, gear up
* Climb $V_{\text{Y}}$ 102 KIAS
* ==*By* 500 AGL==
  * ==Throttle 25"==
  * ==Prop 2500 RPM==
* 1000 AGL
  * Run the climb checklist
    * Disregard the airspeed target of 115 KIAS on the checklist that need not exist between initial $V_{\text{Y}}$ climb and transitioning to "cruise climb" at 130 KIAS
  * ==Pitch for **130 KIAS**==
* Expect under normal training scenarios a ground roll of around 1,400'
  * 95 &#176;F, 2,000' pressure altitude, full fuel with 420 lb of occupants and baggage, no headwind
* Notes
  * ***==Lots of right rudder needed==***
  * Due to rudder being on springs, it is initially a ton, then able to relax slightly
  * KHQZ field elevation: 447' so 500 AGL = 950
  * KADS field elevation: 645' so 500 AGL = 1150
  * At KHQZ turn crosswind at 1200'
  * Until alternator annunciator is fixed, leave landing lights on
    * This draws a bit more current so it doesn't falsely trigger the alternator annunciator
  * Initial altitude bug to 3,500' until clear of the 4,000' Bravo ceiling, then bug 4,500'
  * It is OK to fly level at 25" and 2500 RPM so power is already set for subsequent climb from 3,500' to 4,500'

## Short-field takeoff

* Like normal takeoff but pitch for $V_{\text{X}}$ (87 KIAS) +/-5 KIAS initially
* ==Rotate **84 KIAS** ($V_{\text{R}}$)==
* =="Positive rate, gear up"==
* ==Climb **87 KIAS** ($V_{\text{X}}$)==
* =="Obstacle cleared"==
* ==Climb **102 KIAS** ($V_{\text{Y}}$)==
* Notes
  * Because $V_{\text{R}}$ is 84 KIAS and $V_{\text{X}}$ is 87 KIAS and climb performance is so good, the pitch and holding of 87 KIAS until we call out "obstacle cleared" at 100' AGL will not be a long time

## Pre-Maneuver Checks

* Before doing CHAPS, note how much fuel has burned off of the mains, and then switch to AUX tanks
* Climb to 4,500'

## Steep turns

* Prop: 2500 RPM
* ==**18"**==
* ==**145 KIAS**==
* ==Left turn: pitch **level with the horizon**==
* ==**20"** in right turn==
  * Only need to bump power in right turns to fight against left turning tendencies
* ==Right turn: pitch **2.5&#176; above the horizon**==
* 50&#176; bank
* Notes
  * ==Use 4,500' MSL to start maneuver==
  * Recommend against using trim, it's more difficult to dial in the correct amount of trim than it's worth
  * Only roll out 10&#176; before target heading
  * Tolerances
    * Altitude: +/-100 ft
    * Airspeed: +/-10 kts
    * BankL +/-5&#176;
    * Heading: +/-10&#176; on rollout

## Slow flight

* ==Throttle: **15"**==
* ==Prop: 2500 RPM==
* ==Below 152 KIAS==
  * ==Gear down==
  * ==Flaps 15&#176;==
* ==Below 121 KIAS==
  * ==Flaps full==
* ==Throttle: **17"**==
* ==Target **90 KIAS**==
* ==Climb: full power==
* ==Descent: 13"==
* ==Bank: 5&#176;==
* Recovery
  * Full power
  * Flaps 15&#176;
  * Above 102 KIAS, flaps up, gear up
* Notes
  * Minimum altitude 3,000' AGL (to *complete* maneuver, per AFH)
    * ==Use 4,500' MSL to start maneuver==
  * Pitch for airspeed, power for altitude
  * Tolerances
    * Altitude: +/- 50 ft
    * Heading: +/- 10&#176;
    * Airspeed: +5/-0 kts
    * Bank: +/-5&#176;

## Power-off stall

* ==Throttle: **15"**==
* ==Prop: 2500 RPM==
* ==Below 152 KIAS==
  * ==Gear down==
  * ==Flaps 15&#176;==
* ==Below 121 KIAS==
  * ==Flaps full==
* ==Establish descent at **95 KIAS**==
* Power to idle
* Maintain altitude
* At first indication recover
  * Lower nose (pitch -5&#176; to -10&#176;)
  * Full power
  * Flaps 15&#176;
    * This is part of the expeditious flow above, there is no checking of airspeed or trend
  * Level wings
  * Pitch for 87 KIAS ($V_{\text{X}}$)
    * ==As 87 KIAS approaches smoothly pull up, but not too briskly==
  * ==Pitch for **102 KIAS** ($V_{\text{Y}}$)==
  * Look for positive rate *on altimeter*
  * Flaps up
  * Gear up
  * Recover to level cruise flight
* Notes
  * Minimum altitude 3,000' AGL (to *complete* maneuver, per AFH)
    * ==Use 4,500' MSL to start maneuver==
  * Tolerances
    * Heading: +/- 10&#176;

## Power-on stall

* ==Throttle: **12"**==
* ==Prop: 2500 RPM==
* ==At **102 KIAS** Throttle: **16"**==
* Slowly pitch up
* Recover
  * Lower nose (pitch -2.5&#176;)
  * Full power
  * Pitch for 87 KIAS ($V_{\text{X}}$)
    * ==As 87 KIAS approaches smoothly pull up, but not too briskly==
  * ==Pitch for **102 KIAS** ($V_{\text{Y}}$)==
  * Recover to level cruise flight
* Notes
  * Minimum altitude 3,000' AGL (to *complete* maneuver, per AFH)
    * ==Use 4,500' MSL to start maneuver==

## Accelerated stall

* ==Throttle: **15"**==
* ==Prop: 2500 RPM==
* ==**125 KIAS**==
* ==Bank: **45&#176;**==
* Recovery
  * Reduce angle of attack
  * Then roll wings level
  * Throttles full
  * Climb at $V_{\text{Y}}$ 102 KIAS
  * Throttle: 15"
* Notes
  * Roll smoothly into 45&#176; and get *established*, being mindful of overbanking tendencies
  * Once established, the brisk pull back requires quite a bit of force
  * Reduction of angle of attack in recovery should just be a *relaxing of back pressure, not a push down*
  * Should not lose altitude in the maneuver in recovery
  * Minimum altitude 3,000' AGL (to *complete* maneuver, per AFH)
    * ==Use 4,500' MSL to start maneuver==

## VMC demo

* ==Throttle: **14"**==
* ==Prop: 2500 RPM==
* ==Airspeed: **110 KIAS**==
* Left throttle: slowly close
* Right throttle: slowly full
  * Right rudder and right aileron simultaneously with added power to maintain directional control with wings level
* Pitch up to decelerate no faster than 1 KIAS per second
* *==Recover at first indication of loss of directional control, stall warning, or buffet (including red line)==*
* **==Recover==**
  * ==Right throttle close==
  * ==Pitch below horizon (pitch -10&#176;)==
    * Do this simultaneously with closing throttle
  * ==Above **85 KIAS** ($V_{\text{SSE}}$) right throttle full==
  * ==Airspeed: **99 KIAS** ($V_{\text{YSE}}$)==
  * ==After established in a $V_{\text{YSE}}$ climb recover to level flight and scissor the throttles together 15"==
* Notes
  * Minimum altitude 5,000' AGL (per POH)
    * ==Use 7,500' MSL to start maneuver==
  * On recovery, when pulling power back on operative engine, do so *promptly* (ACS wording) but not doing it abruptly will make coordination with rudder easier.
  * On recovery, wait patiently for $V_{\text{YSE}}$ and add power smoothly to catch and maintain airspeed
  * After establishing a $V_{\text{YSE}}$ climb, do not wait to be told to recover, just recover
  * Tolerances
    * Airspeed: +/- 5 kts
    * Heading: 20&#176; on recovery

## Drag demo

* ==Want to show how the drag associated with configuration changes affects the OEI climb rate at $V_{\text{YSE}}$==
* Start maneuver like $V_{\text{MC}}$ demo but will pitch not to continue to bleed of airspeed, but to hold $V_{\text{YSE}}$ (99 KIAS)
* ==Throttle: **14"**==
* ==Prop: 2500 RPM==
* ==Airspeed: **110 KIAS**==
* Left throttle: slowly close
* Right throttle: slowly full
  * Right rudder and right aileron simultaneously with added power to maintain directional control with wings level
* ==Airspeed **99 KIAS**== ($V_{\text{YSE}}$), note VSI for each of the following
    1. ==Failed engine cowl flaps closed==
        * This is to protect that engine from being overcooled
    2. ==Gear - down==
    3. ==Flaps – 15&#176;==
    4. ==Flaps - full==
    5. ==Failed engine – simulate feather==
        * ~~Prop lever to feather detent~~
        * Throttle: 12"
        * POH page 3-17
    6. ==Flaps – 15&#176;==
    7. ==Flaps – up==
    8. ==Gear up==
    9. ==**93 KIAS** (6 KIAS below $V_{\text{YSE}}$)==
    10. ==**105 KIAS** (6 KIAS above $V_{\text{YSE}}$)==
    11. ==Cowl flaps open==
* Recover
  * Straight and level flight with both engines
* Warm up "dead" engine
  * Throttle: 15"
  * Prop: 2000 RPM
  * Reopen cowl flap on failed engine as needed
    * ==Let CHTs get over 200 &#176;F==
* Notes
  * Can start a bit faster than 110 KIAS, all we need to do in the end is establish $V_{\text{YSE}}$

## Engine Shutdown

* Can be performed by pulling the mixture to idle cutoff

## Maneuvering OEI

* Notes
  * When turning *towards* the dead engine, can use two approaches
    * Just turn wings level and relax rudder pressure to allow the yaw to help turn
    * Can reduce power on the operative engine and accept sacrificing some altitude to help turn towards the the dead engine
  * Tolerances
    * Altitude: +/-100 ft
    * Airspeed: +/-10 kts
    * Heading: +/-10&#176;

## Engine Restart

* Follow the checklist

## Emergency Descent

* "Chop -- Drop -- Prop"
* ==Power idle==
* ==Gear down==
  * When below 152 KIAS
* Prop: 2500 RPM
* ==Bank **30&#176;** away from burning or dead engine==
* ==Pitch **10-15&#176;** nose down==
* ==Airspeed: **140 KIAS**==
* Notes
  * POH calls for props full forward, we won't do it to avoid overspeeding the props
  * We must no overspeed the gear, so there is hard limit at 152 KIAS, hence the 12 KIAS buffer
  * The POH calls for flaps 15&#176;, but it doesn't increase the descent rate substantially so we don't do it

## OEI instrument approach

### Precision Approach

* ==Precision approaches (after the FAF) are done at **99 KIAS** (blue line)==
* ==**115 KIAS** before the FAF==
* ==About **20"** for level flight==
* ==One dot above glideslope/glidepath run GUMPS==
  * Gear down, and flaps 15&#176; comes with it
  * This works well so that right at glideslope intercept we are at 99 KIAS (Blue Line)
* ==Reduce power to **16-18"** and descend on glideslope==
  * OEI approach, full flaps ***when landing is assured*** (that is key phrase)
  * If low minimums, we might break out at 200' AGL, in which case do not plan on using full flaps (unless making a configuration change so low and the risk of destabilizing the approach outweighs the need of e.g. a very short runway)
* Page 3-3 of POH says minimum 99 KIAS approach and on final minimum 90 KIAS
* 12" on inoperative engine to give zero thrust
  * The POH page 3-17 says to retard the prop to the feather detent, but we leave at 2500 RPM

## Normal landing

* ==Throttle: **14"**==
* ==Prop: 2500 RPM==
* ==**115 KIAS** in pattern==
* Midfield downwind
  * Run CGUMPSS
  * Any time gear comes down, also bring flaps 15&#176;
  * ==Make sure to get gear down and flaps 15&#176; *before* we are abeam touchdown point 1000' markers==
* ==Throttle: **16"** after bring gear down and flaps 15&#176; for initial descent==
* ==By the time abeam touchdown point or 4 mile final
  * ==**Gear down**, **flaps 15&#176;**==
  * ==**115 KIAS**==
* ==Start the turn to base a bit before the 45&#176;==
  * So pattern does not get too long
* ==Base or 2 mile final==
  * ==Throttle: **15"**==
  * ==Flaps full==
  * ==**110 KIAS**==
* ==Final==
  * ==Throttle: **13 - 15"**==
  * ==**105 KIAS**==
  * ==**95 KIAS** Short final==
* Power to idle over the threshold
* Notes
  * As part of descent checklist, put fuel on mains

## Short-field landing

* Same approach as normal landing but ==**90 KIAS** on short final==
* Need to hit touchdown point within 100 ft
* ==Call out "simulated flaps up" and "simulated maximum braking"==
* Notes
  * ACS requires not more than 1.3 $V_{\text{SO}}$ which is 95 KIAS in N3622A with $V_{\text{SO}}$ of 73 KIAS
  * Tolerances
    * +100 / -0 ft of touchdown point
    * +/- 5 kts

## Engine failure after VR, no runway remaining

* Run the drill
* This becomes OEI pattern
* Fly pattern at normal airspeeds
  * ==Throttle: **20"** in pattern==
* Other than power settings, configuration is the same with the following exception
  * ==Only difference is not to automatically put 30&#176; flaps on base, only do that ***once landing is assured***==

## Engine failure after liftoff

* 400' AGL minimum
* If gear is up
  * Pitch $V_{\text{XSE}}$ (96 KIAS) or $V_{\text{YSE}}$ (99 KIAS)
  * Execute memory items
* If gear is down
  * Throttles to idle
  * Land straight ahead

## Go-around

* Full power
* Pitch $V_{\text{Y}}$ (102 KIAS)
* Positive rate, flaps up to 15&#176;
* Positive rate, flaps up
* Gear up
* 500' AGL
  * 25"
  * 2500 RPM
* 1000' AGL
  * 115 KIAS
