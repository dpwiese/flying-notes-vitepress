This document describes the systems on Baron N3622A.

## Overview

* [N3622A](https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=3622A)
  * ==Serial TE-777==
  * ==Model: E55==
  * Year: 1969
* Max takeoff weight: 5300 lb
* Max landing weight: 5300 lb
* The following sections cover all the systems as described in CFI ACS Part II Task E. Aircraft Flight Controls and Operation of Systems

## Primary Flight Controls

* Electric trim on pitch axis only
* There seems not to be a separate breaker for pitch trim servo

## Secondary Flight Controls

* **Flaps**
  * Electrically actuated
  * Positions
    * 15&#176; (Approach)
    * 30&#176; (Full)
  * The switch must be pulled out of a detent to change the flap position
  * Slotted type
  * See POH page 7-7
    * *Note: on earlier serials, the flaps had a weird method of operation that allowed selection of flap angles between 15&#176; and 30&#176;, but N3622A does not; the flaps will move to the position selected on the flap handle.*

## Powerplant and Propellers

* **==Engine Overview (CHAND)==**
  * ==**C** - Continental IO-520-C==
    * Fuel injected
    * Six-cylinder
    * Rated at 285 horsepower at 2700 rpm
  * ==**H** - Horizontally opposed==
  * ==**A** - Air cooled==
  * ==**N** - Naturally aspirated==
  * ==**D** - Direct-drive==
* Engine lubrication and cooling
  * 12 quart oil capacity (page 7-25)
  * No published minimum oil, Company policy is 9
  * Has thermostat to control flow through oil coolers
  * Oil type is SAE 50 (above 40 &#176;C) or SAE 30 (below 40 &#176;C)
  * Cowl flaps manually actuated
* **Induction System**
  * N3622A induction system draws air through the ram inlets and draws it through a filter
  * Some Barons have an induction selector that allows for selection of filtered or unfiltered ram air

![E55 Baron (N3622A) induction system. Note: this image is from page 7-18 of the POH for slightly later serial number Barons, but is the best reference that describes the actual induction system on N3622A.](/img/e55-baron-poh-n322et/e55-baron-poh-page-7-18-induction-air.png){width=340}

* **Propeller system**
  * ==2-bladed==
    * McCauley
    * P/N: 2AF34C55
    * 78 inch diameter
  * ==Variable pitch==
  * ==Constant speed==
  * ==Full-feathering==
  * Forces moving prop to feather (high pitch)
    * ==Springs==
    * ==Counterweights==
    * ==Air charge==
  * ==Engine oil under governor-boosted pressure moves the blades to low pitch==
  * ==Has unfeathering accumulators==
    * Gas-assisted pressure to drive oil back into the propeller dome to get the propeller on a stopped engine (that isn't producing oil pressure) out of feather
    * Unfeathering accumulator like a balloon, when oil pump is going its blowing up the balloon
    * Feather is pinching the balloon closed
  * In prop big spring with nitrogen charge inside to push oil out
  * Counterweights on prop to drive prop to feather
  * POH page 1-12, 7-26

  * All three up switches in series = one red light
  * Light bulbs you can rotate to dim for night
  * Gear extended closes the squat switch

  * In case of voltage drop, can try the other regulator
* See POH page 7-31
* Load meters
  * Measure load on alternators
  * Compare with ammeters which show how much the battery is being charged or discharged
