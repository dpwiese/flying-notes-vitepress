# Nonprecision Instrument Approach Types

* **LNAV**
  * See overview section on GPS Approaches
* **LNAV(+V)**
* **LP**
* **LOC**
  * 3-6&#176; beam width
  * 4 times as sensitive as VOR
  * LOC-A, for example (with letter) if approach to runway is too steep (more than 3&#176;)
    * See `CBE LOC-A`
* **VOR**
* **NDB**
  * Need to have working ADF onboard unless the approach has a GPS overlay `NDB OR GPS`
* **LDA**
  * Like a localizer, but there is more than a 3&#176; deviation in its alignment with runway heading
    * [FAA Order 8260.3G](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/Order_8260.3G.pdf) 8-1-2(b)
  * This offset is noted on the approach chart either in the localizer box, or near it as a note
  * May or may not have a glide slope
  * When it has a glideslope it is an APV procedure
* **SDF**
  * Basically extinct
  * Poor man's localizer
  * 6-12&#176; beam width
* **GPS**
  * Usually the MAP is a flyover waypoint (4-pointed star with circle around it)
    * Think circle or "O" around the star for "over"
* **ASR**
  * This is TRACON approach controller
  * Non-precision version of PAR

# Other Approach Types

* **Visual approach**
  * requires 3 sm visibility and 1000' ceilings
  * May be requested by pilot
  * May be assigned by ATC
* **Contact approach**
  * Requires 1 sm visibility and clear of clouds
  * May *only* be requested by pilot
  * Visual contact with ground or preceding aircraft
  * No assurance of obstacle clearance

# Other Non-precision Approach Concepts

* **Visual descent points (VDP)**
  * Point at which a descent from MDA to runway is made with a 3&#176; angle
  * Published on some non-precision approaches with bold "V" near runway
  * 3&#176; is about 300'/nm descent so that can be used to calculate VDP if it is not on approach plate
  * Should always predetermine a VDP if not published
* GPS can be used instead of the VOR receiver for a VOR approach *if the underlying NAVAID is monitored for course guidance*
  * See [Using GPS for Non-GPS Approaches](/cfi/tsa/nav-systems-radar-services#using-gps-for-non-gps-approaches)

# LDA Approach Plate Examples

* May or may not have a glideslope
