## Elements

* Run 5 C's
  * Power full
  * Pitch up to 10 degrees
    * This is in part because during descent the pilot's "head gyros" are "calibrated" to the 3 degree descent
  * Flaps up, landing and taxi light off
  * Suspend GPS
  * Make radio call
* Immediately go missed if full-scale deflection on either needle
* Don't turn before MAP
* Missed while circling approach
  * Turn towards approach end of runway and join missed approach procedure

### Missed Approach Procedures

* **==Missed approach (5 C's)==**
  * **==Cram==**
    * Throttle full
  * **==Climb==**
    * Pitch up and establish climb
  * **==Clean==**
    * Flaps up
    * Lights (landing, taxi, strobes) off
  * **==Click==**
    * Press suspend button
    * Verify CDI source is correct (pink needles)
    * Verify approach has sequenced to next leg
  * **==Confess==**
    * Last call on CTAF
    * Back to approach to coordinate next intention
* Immediately go missed if full-scale deflection on either needle
* If on a circling approach you re-enter clouds you must go missed
* Don't turn before MAP
* Missed while circling approach
  * Turn towards approach end of runway and join missed approach procedure
