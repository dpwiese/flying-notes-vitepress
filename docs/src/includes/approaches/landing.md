## Definition

A straight-in approach is one where the final approach course is aligned within 30&#176; of the runway.

## Purpose

Be able to use smooth positive aircraft control, an efficient instrument scan, and the ability to transition between instrument scanning and outside visual references to complete the landing from a straight-in approach.

## Elements

* Division of attention between instrument and visual references during approach
* Identification of acceptable visual references to continue the approach
* Stay on glide slope and localizer to over runway
* Use checklists as required
* Execute a missed approach by the MAP if visual references are not identified
