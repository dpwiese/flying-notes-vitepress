# Definition

* ==Approaches whose final approach segment is more than 30 degrees different from the landing runway alignment are designated as circling approaches.==
* *==Circling approaches may also be designated when the descent gradient is greater than 400 ft/NM from the FAF to the threshold crossing height (TCH).==*
  * 400 ft/nm approximates a 3.77&#176; descent angle
* *==Or there is no runway clearly identified on the field.==*

# Examples

![KCRS VOR/DME-A. This approach is designed a circling approach because the final approach course is nearly perpendicular to the two available runways, exceeding the maximum of 30&#176; to be associated with a particular runway. Note also that as a VOR/DME approach, both VOR and DME are required.](/img/iap/kcrs-vor-dme-a.png){width=600 border=true}

![KASE RNAV (GPS)-F. This approach is designated a circling approach due to the steep descent between the final approach fix (FAF) and the threshold crossing height. More than 4500 feet need to be lost in the 6.5 nm between the FAF (ALLIX) and reaching the runway, a descent of about 700 ft/nm, corresponding to the vertical descent angle (VDA) of 6.49&#176;.](/img/iap/kase-rnav-gps-f.png){width=600 border=true}

# Overview

* Unless a specific landing runway is specified in the approach clearance, the pilot may land on any runway
* See [FAA-H-8083-16B Instrument Procedures Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/instrument_procedures_handbook) [Chapter 4: Approaches](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/instrument_procedures_handbook/FAA-H-8083-16B_Chapter_4.pdf) page 4-11 for the criteria above.
* Circling minima guarantee 300 foot obstacle clearance with the circling area
* If you re-enter clouds you must go missed
* No more than 30&#176; bank
* Circling approach radii are from *any paved runway* on airport
* From [AIM 5-4-20(f)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap5_section_4.html#$paragraph5-4-20)

    > Pilots should remain at or above the circling altitude until the aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers.

# Direction of Circling

* The takeaway of this issue seems to be that FAA lawyers maintain that [14 CFR &sect; 91.126](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.126), that requires all turns be made to the left, applies to pilots flying circling approaches.
* *However* an increasing amount of guidance (e.g. via [FAA-AC-90-66C](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66C.pdf)) seems to imply that it is only when circling *in VMC* that this rule applies
* It is this latter interpretation that makes sense - when practicing instrument approaches in VMC, pilots should circle in the direction of the VFR traffic pattern, as there very well may be such traffic present.
* Similarly, with regards to safely when circling in IMC, it is the instrument approach procedure that should state whether circling in any particular directions are unsafe and should prohibit them, otherwise it should be assumed that it is safe.
* It seems the primary reason for this ambiguity is that [14 CFR &sect; 91.126](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.126), which governs class G airspace, is referenced by [14 CFR &sect; 91.127](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.127), which governs class E airspace.
* In Class G airspace, there is more ambiguity around expectations of whether VFR traffic may exist or not, given the weather minimums are 1 sm visibility and clear of clouds.
* [FAA-AC-90-66C](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66C.pdf) paragraph 9.7 states:

    > If the Chart Supplement lists a right-hand traffic pattern at a non-towered airport, pilots conducting practice instrument approaches in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) should circle to the right to enter the traffic pattern.

* Paragraph 9.2 of [FAA-AC-90-66C](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66C.pdf) also states the following, which provides support for a circling maneuver *not* being the same as a VFR traffic pattern, and therfore not beholden to the same rules that apply to VFR traffic patterns.

    > Arriving aircraft should enter the airport's traffic pattern at traffic pattern altitude

* Furthermore paragraph 8.2.1.1 of [FAA-AC-90-66C](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66C.pdf) states the following, which, if the maneuvering required as part of a circling approach is considered "outside the traffic pattern" then [14 CFR &sect; 91.126](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.126) does not apply.

    > An aircraft outside the traffic pattern would not be bound by &sect; 91.126(b)

* Paragraph 9.9 of [FAA-AC-90-66C](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66C.pdf) states:

    > Use of standard traffic patterns (left turns) for all aircraft and CTAF procedures by radio-equipped aircraft are required at all airports without operating control towers unless indicated otherwise by visual markings, light gun signals, airport publications, or published approach procedure. A pilot should understand that other traffic patterns (right turns) may already be in common use at some airports or that special circumstances or conditions exist that may prevent use of the standard traffic pattern.

* Do IMC conditions or other visibility restrictions (e.g. flying from the right seat) on a circling approach count as conditions "that may prevent the use of the standard traffic pattern"?
* Recall the aerobatic box to the west side of KHWY when active switched the pattern to right traffic for 33, also there were remarks on the weather about helicopters flying right hand patterns. The latter seems to be to adhere to [14 CFR &sect; 91.126(b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.126#p-91.126(b)(2)) but switching of the traffic pattern due to aerobatic activity over remarks on the AWOS is less clear.
* Paragraph 9.11.3 of [FAA-AC-90-66C](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66C.pdf) states:

    > Pilots conducting instrument approaches in VMC should be particularly alert for other aircraft in the pattern so as to avoid interrupting the flow of traffic and should bear in mind they do not have priority over other VFR traffic. Pilots are reminded that circling approaches must comply with &sect; 91.126(b) unless the approach procedure explicitly states otherwise. Remember, if the Chart Supplement lists right-hand traffic at a non-towered airport, pilots conducting practice instrument approaches in VMC should circle to the right to enter the traffic pattern.

* This language, to specify "in VMC" was added in paragraph 9.6 of [FAA-AC-90-66B-CHG-1](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66B_CHG_1.pdf)
* In addition, the language "unless the approach procedure explicitly states otherwise" seems to *not* be how Flight Standards responded to the example of the RNAV (GPS) RWY 12 at KTCY in [IFR Magazine - Circling Revisited](https://www.ifr-magazine.com/system/circling-revisited/), rather it was *implicitly stated* that circling to the right was acceptable only because circling to the left was not authorized.

# LDA Approaches

* There are some exceptions to this with LDA (and perhaps other) approaches
  * `PHNL LDA RWY 26L`
  * `KDCA LDA Y RWY 19`
  * `KDCA LDA Z RWY 19`
* The reason is probably described in [FAA Order 8260.3G](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/Order_8260.3G.pdf)
* The majority of LDA approaches are designated circling approaches consistent with the definition above, these are just some notable exceptions to that rule.
