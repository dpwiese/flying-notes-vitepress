# Airframe Icing

* For ice to form need
  * Visible moisture
  * Surface temperatures freezing or below
    * Often occurs when outside temperatures are between -20 and 5 &#176;C
* Typically forms on wing and propellor
* **Clear ice**
  * ==Most dangerous==
  * ==Happens when flying through rain==
  * Most rapid ice formation
  * Typically forms in cumuliform clouds
* **Rime ice**
  * ==Happens when flying through clouds==
* **Mixed ice**
  * ==Has the properties of both clear and rime icing==
  * Large and small supercooled droplets coexist
  * Appearance is whitish, irregular and rough
* **Frost**
  * Aircraft surface temperature and dew point both below freezing
* **Freezing rain**
  * Rain falling from warmer air into air that is colder than freezing
  * Ice pellets indicates there is freezing rain above

## Adverse Effects of Airframe Icing

* Disturbed airflow over wings and other surfaces
* More drag
* Less lift
* Reduces stall angle-of-attack
* Adds weight
