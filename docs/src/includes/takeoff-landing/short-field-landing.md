# Short-Field Approach and Landing

## Approach

* Maintain manufacturer's published approach airspeed or in its absence not more than 1.3 Vso
* In the Piper Archer this is 59 KIAS (at max gross weight)

## Retraction of Flaps

The ACS states:

> Use manufacturerâ€™s recommended procedures for airplane configuration and braking.

In the case of the Piper Archer, as an example, the POH states:

> As the airplane slows down, gently lower the nose and apply the brakes. Braking is most effective when flaps are raised and back pressure is applied to the control wheel, putting most of the aircraft weight on the main wheels.

* In the case of the Piper Archer, upon touchdown retracting the flaps, verbalizing "simulating maximum braking" and using full aft stabilator with light brakes is appropriate.
* AFH page 13-21 says flap retraction during the landing rollout is discouraged, however, unless there is a clear, operational need.
* It should not be accomplished as routine with each landing.
* Landing conditions that involve a short field, high winds, or strong crosswinds are just about the only situations where flap retraction on the landing rollout should be considered.
* When there is an operational need to retract the flaps just after touchdown, it needs to be done deliberately with the flap handle positively identified before it is moved.

# Common Errors

1. Improper use of landing performance data and limitations.
2. Failure to establish approach and landing configuration at appropriate time or in proper sequence.
3. Failure to establish and maintain a stabilized approach.
4. Improper technique in use of power, wing flaps, and trim.
5. Inappropriate removal of hand from throttles.
6. Improper procedure during roundout and touchdown.
7. Poor directional control after touchdown.
8. Improper use of brakes (landplane).
