# Elements of Short-Field Approach and Landing

1. **How to determine landing performance and limitations.**
2. **Configuration and trim.**
3. **Proper use of pitch and power to maintain desired approach angle.**
4. **Barriers and other hazards which should be considered.**
5. **Effect of wind.**
6. **Selection of touchdown and go-around points.**
7. **A stabilized approach at the recommended airspeed to the selected touchdown point.**
8. **Coordination of flight controls.**
9. **A precise ground track.**
10. **Timing, judgment, and control procedure during roundout and touchdown.**
11. **Directional control after touchdown.**
    * AFH page 13-21 says flap retraction during the landing rollout is discouraged, however, unless there is a clear, operational need.
    * It should not be accomplished as routine with each landing.
    * Landing conditions that involve a short field, high winds, or strong crosswinds are just about the only situations where flap retraction on the landing rollout should be considered.
    * When there is an operational need to retract the flaps just after touchdown, it needs to be done deliberately with the flap handle positively identified before it is moved.
12. **Use of brakes (landplane).**
13. **Use of checklist.**
14. **After landing runway incursion procedures.**

# Common Errors Related to Short-Field Approach and Landing

1. **Improper use of landing performance data and limitations.**
2. **Failure to establish approach and landing configuration at appropriate time or in proper sequence.**
3. **Failure to establish and maintain a stabilized approach.**
4. **Improper technique in use of power, wing flaps, and trim.**
5. **Inappropriate removal of hand from throttles.**
6. **Improper procedure during roundout and touchdown.**
7. **Poor directional control after touchdown.**
8. **Improper use of brakes (landplane).**
