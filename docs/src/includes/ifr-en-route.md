* See the FAA document [Aeronautical Chart Users' Guide IFR Enroute Charts](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/aero_guide/) for descriptions of terms and symbols used on IFR enroute charts.
* Updated every 56 days
* IFR low chart is used under 18,000 ft.
* Victor airways - from 1200 AGL up to *but not including FL 180*
* ==T-Routes - like victor airways but for GPS navigation on IFR low charts==
  * ==Can use T-Routes with a suitable GPS==
  * On IFR high charts these are Q-Routes
  * [AIP ENR 3.3 Area Navigation (RNAV) Routes](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aip_html/part2_enr_section_3.3.html)
  * [AIM Chapter 1 Section 2 Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) and Area Navigation (RNAV)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_2.html)
* **Magnetic Reference Bearing (MRB)**
  * Published magnetic bearing between two waypoints on an RNAV/GPS/GNSS route
  * Used to enhance situational awareness by associating magnetic course with GPS leg to check against compass
* Blue or green airports on IFR chart have instrument approach procedure (IAP) and/or radar minima, where this is related to ASR or PAR (radar) approaches

## DME Distance Arrows on Low Enroute Chart

![Consider SCAPE intersection. The segment between SCAPE and HGR is 21 nm. However, due to the absence of the DME arrow between HGR and SCAPE, 21 DME from HGR cannot be used to identify SCAPE. The DME arrow does not include the distance with the arrow when the distance value is "obvious" - for the first segment where no addition or rounding is required to determine DME to a fix which is multiple segments from a VOR. Note: some features have been omitted from the chart for clarity.](/img/scape-decluttered.jpg){width=600}
