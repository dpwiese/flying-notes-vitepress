# SIGMETs and AIRMETs

* **AIRMET (WA)**:
  * Stands for Airmen's Meteorological Information
  * Less intense than requiring a SIGMET, used in preflight to enhance flight safety.
  * ==Forecasts valid for 6 hours==
  * Issued every 6 hours, as well as unscheduled updates.
  * Include info about IFR, extensive mountain obscuration, turbulence, strong surface winds, icing, freezing levels.
  * *Of operational interest to all aircraft*, ==*potentially hazardous to light aircraft*==
    * Pilots of heavy aircraft aren't really going to worry about AIRMETs
  * Types
    * **Sierra**: describes IFR conditions and/or extensive mountain obscurations
    * **Tango**: Turbulence, sustained surface winds more than 30kts, low level wind shear
    * **Zulu**: Moderate icing and freezing level heights
  * Includes forecast of moderate icing, moderate turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30 knots or greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,000 feet and/or visibilities less than three miles, and extensive mountain obscurement.

    * The definition here is a bit different than in PHAK, for example
* **SIGMET (WS)**
  * Significant Meteorological Information [AIM 7-1-6 Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-6)
  * *Weather that is potentially hazardous to all aircraft*
  * ==Forecasts valid for 4 hours==
  * Types
    * Severe icing
    * Severe turbulence / clear air turbulence (CAT)
    * IMC due to sandstorms, volcanic ash
* **Convective SIGMET (WST)**
  * Advises of significant weather due to thunderstorms
  * Severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, low-level wind shear
  * ==*Hazardous to all categories of aircraft*==
  * Issued hourly at H+55
  * ==Forecasts valid for 2 hours==
  * ==Conditions to issue Convective SIGMET==
    * ==Severe thunderstorms due to 50 kts or greater surface winds or hail more than 3/4" in diameter==
    * ==Tornadoes==
    * ==A line of thunderstorms 60+ nm long==
    * ==Severe or embedded thunderstorms for 30+ minutes==
    * ==Area of thunderstorms covering at least 40% of the area concerned== and exhibiting a very strong radar reflectivity or a significant satellite or lightning signature.
