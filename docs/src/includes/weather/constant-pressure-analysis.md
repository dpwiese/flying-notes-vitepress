# Constant Pressure Analysis

* Gives
  * Wind
  * Observed temperature
  * Temperature/dew point spread
* For a flight at 10,000 MSL use the 700 mb chart
  * This can be figured out roughly by remembering the standard sea level pressure corresponding to 29.92 inHg is 1013.2 mb and using the resulting lapse rate of 33.9 mb per 1000 ft. to get about 700 mb
* It is for "flight levels" because it is at constant pressure levels rather than constant altitude?
