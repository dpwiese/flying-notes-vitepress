# PIREP

* **PIREP** - Pilot report of observed weather conditions.
  * **UA** - Routine report
  * **UUA** - Urgent repot
* Pilots are pretty good about reporting icing and turbulence
* Good idea when checking in with a controller to state how the ride is
  * "Approach Cessna 12345 level 8,000 light chop"
* Most accurate weather report
* When reading a PIREP, each piece of information is within the forward slashes
* Required info for PIREP: location, time, altitude MSL, type of aircraft, weather encountered.

## PIREP icing reporting levels

See: [AIM 7-1-19 PIREPs Relating to Airframe Icing](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-19).

1. **Trace Icing**
    * Ice becomes noticeable or perceiptible
    * The rate of accumulation is slightly greater than the rate of sublimation
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is less than 1/4 inch (6 mm) per hour on the outer wing
    * The pilot should consider exiting the icing conditions before they become worse
2. **Light Icing**
    * The rate of ice accumulation requires occasional cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is 1/4 inch to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing
    * The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition.
    * Problem if flight is prolonged more than one hour, no problem if anti-icing equipment used
3. **Moderate Icing**
    * The rate of ice accumulation requires frequent cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing
    * The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition as soon as possible.
    * Short encounters are potentially hazardous; anti-icing or diversion is necessary
4. **Severe Icing**
    * The rate of ice accumulation is such that ice protection systems fail to remove the accumulation of ice and ice accumulates in locations not normally prone to icing, such as areas aft of protected surfaces and any other areas identified by the manufacturer
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is more than 3 inches (7.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing
    * By regulation, immediate exit is required
    * De/anti-icing insufficient to deal with hazard; need immediate diversion

## PIREP turbulence reporting levels

See: [AIM 7-1-21 PIREPs Relating to Turbulence](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-21).

* **Light**
  * *Momentary* without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude
  * *Note: keyword is momentary*
* **Moderate**
  * Variations in indicated airspeed
* **Severe**
  * Aircraft may be momentarily out of control
* **Extreme**
  * Impossible to control
* **Chop**
  * Rhythmic bumpiness without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude
