# Prognostic Chart

* See: [Prog Charts](https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/#progchart)
* Map displaying weather forecast.
* Forecast - up to 7 days for surface
* Surface charts show pressure systems and fronts.
* Significant weather charts (surface level, low level, mid level, high level) show:
  * Ceiling and visibility
  * Turbulence
  * Freezing levels
* One of the best uses of a low-level prognostic chart is determining areas to avoid
* *Note: areas of continuous rain are hatched in but I can't find the legend for that anywhere.*
* Example `**` means light snow (see GFA legend above)
* Snapshot of weather expected at specific time
* Low = <FL240 | High = >FL240
* Turbulence, IFR/MVFR/VFR, Ground Feezing Level
