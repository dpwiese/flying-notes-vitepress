* When obtaining weather information, start looking far in advance
  * Use standard sources of weather information, such as apps and online
  * For example, [Prog Charts](https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/#progchart) provides a forecast 7 days out
* Start big picture and then zoom in
  * Look at frontal activity, pressure systems
* See [AIM 7-1-2](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-2)
