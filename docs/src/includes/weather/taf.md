# TAF

* Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)
* ==Covers five statute mile radius around an airport==
* ==Each TAF is valid for a 24 or 30-hour time period and is updated four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z==
  * 30 hour TAFs are usually at airports that serve long-range aircraft, so they can get their TAFs in more advance before taking off
* Some common
  * `NSW` - No significant weather
  * `SKC` - Sky clear
  * `SLP` - Sea level pressure
  * `TEMPO` - Last for less than an hour and occur during less than half of the time period specified
