# Appendix

* *All local barometric pressure readings are converted to a sea level pressure*.
  * At an airport at elevation with altimeter setting of 29.92 needs to cause altimeter to read field elevation, as does an airport at sea level with altimeter of 29.92. Thus in these two cases *the same altimeter setting corresponds to a different barometric pressure at the field*.
  * *To achieve this, each station converts its barometric pressure by adding approximately 1 inHg for every 1,000 feet of elevation.*
* ==***Wind directions on weather observations based on true north.***==
* Wind direction is reported by the direction *from which it originates*
* All charts and textual sources (METAR, TAF, winds aloft, surface analysis charts, etc) use true north as the reference.
* ATIS/AWOS/ASOS broadcasts, or any information a controller gives you over the radio, is magnetic.
* From [AIM 7–1–10 Weather Observing Programs](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-10):

  > Wind direction broadcast over FAA radios is in reference to magnetic north.

::: tip
The general rule regarding weather reported winds are referenced to true or magnetic direction is: if you read it, it's true. If you hear it, it's magnetic.

* Basic definitions used across the different products
  * ==**LIFR**: Low IFR - ceiling less than 500ft and/or visibility less than 1 mile==
  * ==**IFR**: Ceiling 500 to less than 1,000ft and/or visibility 1 to less than 3 miles==
  * ==**MVFR**: Marginal VFR - ceiling 1,000 to 3,000ft and/or visibility 3 to 5 miles==
  * ==**VFR**: Ceiling greater than 3,000ft and visibility greater than 5 miles, sky clear==
  * **Ceiling** is the lowest layer of clouds reported as being *broken or overcast*
    * or the vertical visibility into an obscuration like fog or haze
  * **Visibility** is the greatest horizontal distance at which prominent objects can be viewed with the naked eye
