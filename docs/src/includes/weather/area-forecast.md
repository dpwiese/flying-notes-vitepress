# Area Forecast

* Area Forecast (FA)
* [aviationweather.gov](https://www.aviationweather.gov) has discontinued textual area forecasts, but it seems they are still on FAA exams
* From [https://www.aviationweather.gov/areafcst](https://www.aviationweather.gov/areafcst):

  > THE TEXT AREA FORECAST FOR THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. TO GET THE FORECAST FOR THESE AREAS CHECK THE GFA TOOL.

* The FA gives a picture of clouds, general weather conditions, and visual meteorological conditions (VMC) expected over a large area encompassing several states.
* There are six areas for which area forecasts are published in the contiguous 48 states.
* Area forecasts are issued three times a day and are valid for 18 hours.
* Note the difference in valid time of 12 hours for the *forecast* and an additional 6 for the categorical *outlook*
  * I'm not really sure exactly the difference between these two
  * On the FAA exam, they will try to trick based on these two things
