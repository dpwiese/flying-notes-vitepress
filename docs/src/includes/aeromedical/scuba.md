# Evolved Gases From Scuba Diving

* SCUBA Considerations (Induced Decompression Sickness)
* Experience low barometric pressures => Nitrogen comes out of physical solution and forms bubbles
* SCUBA, wait 24 hours if flying above 8,000'. Below 8,000 ft., 12 hours
* After diving *where a controlled ascent was not required* wait at least 12 hours before flying to *flight altitudes* (not cabin altituddes) of 8,000 ft. MSL or less
* After diving *where a controlled ascent was required* wait at least 24 hours before flying to 8,000 ft. MSL or less
