# Hypothermia

* There is almost no mention of hypothermia in any FAA documents directed to airplane pilots.
* It should not be a factor in typical closed-cockpit general aviation airplanes with working cabin heat.
* In cold environments a pilot should be dressed sufficiently comfortably to conduct the preflight.
* In the event that cabin heat is not working, consider not flying at altitudes where the cabin will be uncomfortably cold, much less so cold that hypothermia becomes a concern.
* [FAA-H-8083-11 Balloon Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-11.pdf) seems to be the best FAA reference regarding hypothermia and even that is relatively sparse on details.
  * Dress warmly.
  * Hypoxia may be aggravated by the cold.
  * Be aware of symptoms of hypothermia and frostbite.
  * Have a plan in place to deal with medical emergencies.
