# Hyperventilation

::: warning Hyperventilation
An increase in the rate and depth of breathing that results in insufficient CO2 in the blood stream.
:::

* Can happen when anxious, scared, or nervous
* Symptoms perceived by an aviator who is hyperventilation include
  * Dizziness
  * Lightheadedness
  * Tingling
  * Numbness
  * Visual disturbances
  * Loss of coordination
  * Visual impairment
  * Unconsciousness
  * Hot and cold sensations
  * Muscle spasms
* The treatment of hyperventilation requires a voluntary reduction in the rate and depth of ventilation.
  * Treatment by slowing breathing rate or breathing into a bag
* The signs and symptoms of hyperventilation can be easily confused with those of hypoxic hypoxia.
* Rapid or deep breathing while using supplemental oxygen can cause hyperventilation
* Because hypoxia and hyperventilation are so similar and both can incapacitate so quickly, the recommended treatment procedures for aviators is to correct both problems simultaneously
  * Administer 100 percent oxygen under pressure
  * Reduce the rate and depth of breathing
  * Check the oxygen equipment to ensure proper functioning
  * Descend to a lower altitude where hypoxia is unlikely to occur
