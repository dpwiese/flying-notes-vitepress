# Spatial Disorientation

::: warning Spatial Orientation
Defines our natural ability to maintain our body orientation and/or posture in relation to the surrounding environment.
:::

* Vestibular System (inner ear/balance) + Somatosensory System (nerves/gravity) + Visual System
* Sensory mismatch can cause illusions leading to *spatial disorientation*.
* Vestibular system = fluid in inner-ear makes contact with hairs, deflect
* Basically all vestibular illusions below are caused by a steady-state condition being reached in the inner ear that is not straight-and-level flight
  * Return to straight-and-level flight from this condition then feels wrong causing the pilot to react incorrectly
* Posture considerations
* ICEFLAGS is an acronym that can be used to help memorize a mix of some of the more common vestibular and visual illusions below.

## Vestibular Illusions

* **Inversion Illusion**
  * An abrupt change from climb to straight-and-level flight can stimulate the otolith organs enough to create the illusion of tumbling backwards
  * Pilot may compensate by pushing the aircraft nose towards the ground
* **Coriolis Illusion**
  * Inner ear getting used to turning equilibrium
  * Turning head perturbs this equilibrium and can give pilot sense of different motion
* **Elevator Illusion**
  * An abrupt upward vertical acceleration, as can occur in an updraft, can stimulate the otolith organs to create the illusion of being in a climb.
* **The Leans**
  * Sudden return to level flight following a gradual and prolonged turn
  * When gradual turn rate is below the detection threshold of the semicircular canals
* **Graveyard Spiral**
  * As in other illusions, a pilot in a prolonged coordinated, constant-rate turn may experience the illusion of not turning
  * In recovery from the turn the pilot feels a turn the other way, so compensates back the original direction
  * The turn can result in altitude loss, requiring more backpressure, which increases the rate of turn, and results in a spiral to the ground
* **Somatogravic Illusion**
  * A rapid acceleration, such as experienced during takeoff, stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the head backwards.
  * Pilot may compensate by pushing the aircraft nose towards the ground

## Visual Illusions

* **False Horizon**
  * A sloping cloud formation, an obscured horizon, an aurora borealis, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain geometric patterns of ground lights can provide inaccurate visual information, or "false horizon," when attempting to align the aircraft with the actual horizon.
* **Autokinesis**
  * Staring at a single point of light against a dark background for more than a few seconds the light appears to move.
  * During flight a pilot may attempt to align the aircraft with this moving light and cause them to lose control.
* **Reversible Perspective Illusion**
  * At night, an aircraft may appear to be moving away from a second aircraft when it is, in fact, approaching a second aircraft. This illusion often occurs when an aircraft is flying parallel to another's course.
  * To determine the direction of flight, pilots should observe aircraft lights and their relative position to the horizon. If the intensity of the lights increases, the aircraft is approaching; if the lights dim, the aircraft is moving away.
* **Size-Distance Illusion**
  * This illusion results from viewing a source of light that is increasing or decreasing in brightness. Pilots may interpret the light as approaching or retreating.
* **Flicker Vertigo**
  * A light flickering at a rate between 4 and 20 cycles per second can produce unpleasant and dangerous reactions. Such conditions as nausea, vomiting, and vertigo may occur. On rare occasions, convulsions and unconsciousness may also occur.
  * Proper scanning techniques at night can prevent pilots from getting flicker vertigo.
* **Runway Width Illusion**
  * A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is, especially when runway length-to-width relationships are comparable.
  * The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach
* **Runway and Terrain Slopes Illusion**
  * An upsloping runway, upsloping terrain, or both can create an illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is.
* **Featureless Terrain Illusion**
  * An absence of surrounding ground features, as in an overwater approach over darkened areas or terrain made featureless by snow, can create an illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is.
* **Water Refraction**
  * Rain on the windscreen can create an illusion of being at a higher altitude due to the horizon appearing lower than it is.
  * This can result in the pilot flying a lower approach.
* **Haze**
  * Atmospheric haze can create an illusion of being at a greater distance and height from the runway.
  * As a result, the pilot has a tendency to be low on the approach.
* **Fog**
  * Flying into fog can create an illusion of pitching up. Pilots who do not recognize this illusion often steepen the approach abruptly.
* **Ground Lighting Illusions**
  * Lights along a straight path, such as a road or lights on moving trains, can be mistaken for runway and approach lights.
  * Bright runway and approach lighting systems, especially where few lights illuminate the surrounding terrain, may create the illusion of less distance to the runway.
  * The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will often fly a higher approach.

## Preventing Visual Illusions

::: tip
When experiencing spatial disorientation make sure to rely on flight instruments.
:::

* ==Stay proficient==
* ==Avoid flying in conditions for which you are not rated and/or not proficient==
* ==Rely on instruments==
* Learn ahead about airport you will be landing at for information on runway slope, terrain, and lighting.
* Reference altimeter
* Overfly the field
* Use approach lighting (VASI or PAPI)
