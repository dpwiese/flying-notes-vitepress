# Arrival Procedures

* Arrival procedures transition the instrument pilot from the en route structure to a fix in the terminal area from which an instrument approach can be conducted
* [FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf)
  * Chapter 10: IFR Flight
    * Page 10-9: Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs)

## Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR)

* "Fly" vs. "Descend via" the arrival
* [FAA Climb Via/Descend Via Speed Clearances Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/Climb_Descend_Via_FAQ.pdf)
* Descend via
  * Comply with the lateral path of the STAR
  * Comply with all published speed restrictions
  * Comply with all published altitude restrictions
* =="Descend via" means we can descend to the lowest altitude restriction on the STAR==
  * So if a given waypoint has, for example, a restriction to cross at or above 10,000', then that is the lowest we can descend until cleared lower
  * ==Can only descend lower with clearance to do so, or if *cleared for an approach*==
  * Being told to expect a particular runway or approach is not sufficient to descend lower
* Similar rules apply for "Climb Via" with respect to a SID

## Terminal Arrival Areas (TAA)

* [AIM 5-4-5(d)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap5_section_4.html#$paragraph5-4-5)
* The TAA provides a transition from the en route structure to the terminal environment with little required pilot/air traffic control interface for aircraft equipped with Area Navigation (RNAV) systems.
* Basic RNAV approach procedure underlying TAA is the "T" structure
* 30 nm radius around each of the IAFs
* An aircraft inside a TAA is established on a published segment of an approach
* Obey minimum altitudes when in the TAA and cleared for the approach
* *TAAs provide a structure to help understand how the approach will commence, including which IAF it will start from, whether the hold-in-lieu of procedure turn is needed, and what altitude to fly, but this should all be depicted anyhow via e.g. NoPT, and controller communication as to which fix the pilot is cleared to and at what altitude. If in doubt, confirm with ATC.*
