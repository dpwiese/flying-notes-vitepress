# POH and AFM

## FAA Approved Pilot Operating Handbooks / AFM

* Flight manuals and operating handbooks are concise reference books that provide specific information about a particular aircraft or subject.
* They contain basic facts, information, and/or instructions for the pilot about the operation of an aircraft, flying techniques, etc., and are intended to be kept on hand for ready reference.
* The aircraft owner/information manual is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains general information about the make and model of the aircraft.
* The manual is not approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is not specific to an individual aircraft.
* The manual provides general information about the operation of an aircraft, is not kept current, and cannot be substituted for the AFM/POH.

* An AFM is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and approved by the FAA. This book contains the information and instructions required to operate an aircraft safely.
* A pilot must comply with this information which is specific to a particular make and model of aircraft, usually by serial number.
* An AFM contains the operating procedures and limitations of that aircraft.
* Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 requires that pilots comply with the operating limitations specified in the approved flight manuals, markings, and placards.

* Originally, flight manuals followed whatever format and content the manufacturer felt was appropriate, but this changed with the acceptance of Specification No. 1 prepared by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA).
* Specification No. 1 established a standardized format for all general aviation airplane and helicopter flight manuals.

* The POH is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information. If "POH" is used in the main title, a statement must be included on the title page indicating that sections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM.

* The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual. The typical AFM/POH contains the following nine sections
    1. General
    2. Limitations
    3. Emergency Procedures
    4. Normal Procedures
    5. Performance
    6. Weight and Balance/Equipment List
    7. Systems Description
    8. Handling, Service, and Maintenance
    9. Supplements
* Manufacturers also have the option of including additional sections, such as one on Safety and Operational Tips or an alphabetical index at the end of the POH.

    > The title [of the document shall be] "Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual" for all airplanes except those for which the airplane manufacturer elected to provide a separate FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual. In the latter case, the title shall be "Pilot's Operating Handbook".

    > Note: After the effective date of this revision, Pilot's Operating Handbooks for newly manufactured airplanes must be FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manuals.
