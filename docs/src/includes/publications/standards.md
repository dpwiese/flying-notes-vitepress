# Test / Certification Standards

* [Practical Test Standards (PTS)](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_standards)
  * Older version of testing standards.
  * The PTS primarily provides metrics to define acceptable performance of the "flight proficiency" skills listed in 14 CFR part 61 for a given certificate or rating.
* [Airman Certification Standards (ACS)](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs)
  * The ACS is an enhanced version of the Practical Test Standards (PTS) that started replacing the PTS in 2016, and will eventually replace all PTS.
  * It adds task-specific knowledge and risk management elements to each PTS Area of Operation and Task.
  * The result is a comprehensive presentation that integrates the standards for what an applicant needs to know, consider, and do in order to pass both the knowledge test and the practical test for a certificate or rating.
