    > The SAFO process re-establishes a communication channel between Flight Standards and operators. This channel permits a policy-making division such as AFS-200 to convey important safety information concurrently to FAA field offices and to operators in a timely manner, without undue delays caused by coordination among government offices. SAFOs frequently contain recommended action to be accomplished by operators.
