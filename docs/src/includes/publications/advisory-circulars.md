# Advisory Circulars

* An Advisory Circular (AC) is an informational document that the FAA wants to distribute to the aviation community.
* This can be in the form of a text book used in a classroom or a one page document.
  * [FAA-AC-00-6B Aviation Weather](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1029851)
  * [FAA-AC-00-45H Aviation Weather Services](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1030235)
* ACs provide a single, uniform, agency-wide system that the FAA uses to deliver advisory material to FAA customers, industry, the aviation community, and the public.
* An AC may be needed to
  * Provide an acceptable, clearly understood method for complying with a regulation
  * Standardize implementation of a regulation or harmonize implementation for the international aviation community
  * Resolve a general misunderstanding of a regulation
  * Respond to a request from some government entity, such as General Accounting Office, NTSB, or the Office of the Inspector General
  * Help the industry and FAA effectively implement a regulation
  * Explain requirements and limits of an FAA grant program
  * Expand on standards needed to promote aviation safety, including the safe operation of airports
* There are three parts to an AC number, as in 25-42C.
  * The first part of the number identifies the subject matter area of the AC and corresponds to the appropriate 14 CFR part.
    * For example, an Advisory Circular on "Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors" is [FAA-AC-61-65J](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1043278).
    * Since ACs are numbered sequentially within each subject area, the second part of the number beginning with the dash identifies this sequence.
    * The third part of the number is a letter assigned by the originating office and shows the revision sequence if an AC is revised.
