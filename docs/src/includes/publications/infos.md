# INFOs

* Information for Operators
* [InFO 06001 - Introducing InFOs](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/airports/runway_safety/controllers/resources/inFO06001.pdf)

    > Much like SAFOs, which contain critical safety information, an InFO message contains valuable information for operators that should help them meet certain administrative, regulatory, or operational requirements with relatively low urgency or impact on safety. InFOs contain information or a combination of information and recommended action to be taken by the respective operators identified in each individual InFO.
