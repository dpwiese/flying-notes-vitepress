# Filing an IFR Flight Plan

* File flight plan to IAF
  * Use time to IAF
  * Altitude is initial cruising altitude
  * *I think this is different than what was in the FAA written?*

* IFR flight plans remain in system from 30 minutes before ETA to 2 hours after

    > To prevent computer saturation in the en route environment, parameters have been established to delete proposed departure flight plans which have not been activated. Most centers have this parameter set so as to delete these flight plans a minimum of 2 hours after the proposed departure time or Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT). To ensure that a flight plan remains active, pilots whose actual departure time will be delayed 2 hours or more beyond their filed departure time, are requested to notify ATC of their new proposed departure time.

![ARTCC flight plan deletion times. 7110.11EE Table 6-2-1](/img/7110-10-6-2-2-flight-plan-deletion.png){width=520}

* File flight plan at least 30 minutes before ETD
  * [AIM 5-1-6(a)(6)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap5_section_1.html#$paragraph5-1-6)
* Can file an IFR flight plan up to 22.5 hours before departure time
  * [7110.10EE 6-2-2(e)(5)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/fs_html/chap6_section_2.html)

* Flight plan uses true airspeed when filing
* VFR flight plans are held for 1 hour after proposed departure time
* Have 30 minutes to close VFR flight plan after ETA
* If no runway gradient information is specified in the [Chart Supplement](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dafd/) (formerly called airport facility directory or AF/D) then by definition it is less than 0.3 percent
