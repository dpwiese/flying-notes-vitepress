# Filing an IFR Flight Plan

* File flight plan to IAF
  * Use time to IAF
  * Altitude is initial cruising altitude
  * *I think this is different than what was in the FAA written?*
* For aircraft equipment suffixes also see
  * [7110.65 2-3-8 Aircraft Equipment Suffix](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap2_section_3.html)
  * [AIM Appendix 4. FAA Form 7233âˆ’4 International Flight Plan](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/appendix_4.html#ubFHX14cShaw)

* Flight plan uses true airspeed when filing
* VFR flight plans are held for 1 hour after proposed departure time
* Have 30 minutes to close VFR flight plan after ETA
* If no runway gradient information is specified in the [Chart Supplement](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dafd/) (formerly called airport facility directory or AF/D) then by definition it is less than 0.3 percent
