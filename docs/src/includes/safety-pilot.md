# Safety Pilot Regulations

In the discussion around the use of a safety pilot a key question that must be answered prior to initiating the flight is: who is the acting PIC for the flight.
The safety pilot can (under certain conditions) act as the PIC, or the pilot under the foggles may be PIC.
In any case, when a safety pilot is used in VMC, they are a required crew member.
The following bullets are true regardless of the designation of acting PIC.

* A safety pilot is required when flying under foggles.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.109(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.109#p-91.109(c)(1))
* The safety pilot must be at least a private pilot with appropriate category and class rating.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.109(c)(1)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.109#p-91.109(c)(1)(i))
* Regardless whether or not the safety pilot is acting PIC they _do_ need a medical to serve as a required crewmember.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.3(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.3#p-61.3(c)(1))
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.23(a)(3)(ii)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.23#p-61.23(a)(3)(ii))

* The pilot under the foggles gets to log PIC time when they are the sole manipulator of the flight controls.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(1)(i))
  * This assumes the pilot under the foggles is rated in the aircraft being flow.

There are some additional regulations in [14 CFR &sect;91.109](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-91.109) that are probably less likely, but may be encountered in real life, for example requirements around dual controls.

## Sole Manipulator of the Flight Controls

Before moving on to designation of the acting PIC, it's important to be clear on the following:

* The sole manipulator of the flight controls can log PIC time, whether they are instrument rated or not and regardless of weather conditions.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(1)(i))
* So this is the only requirement in order to log approaches and other procedures towards currency.

## Designating the Acting PIC

Now we look at how requirements change depending on who is the acting PIC.

### Safety Pilot is Acting PIC

If the safety pilot is acting PIC then:

* Safety pilot needs a current flight review to act as PIC.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.56(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.56#p-61.56(c))
* The safety pilot needs complex / high performance endorsements as appropriate to act as PIC.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.31(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.31#p-61.31(e))
* The safety pilot gets to log PIC time when they other pilot is under the foggles or if the safety pilot is manipulating the flight controls.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(iii)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(1)(iii))

### Pilot Under Foggles is the Acting PIC

* The safety pilot can log SIC time as a required crewmember.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(f)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(f)(2))

## Flight in Actual IMC

* Whoever is the acting PIC must be instrument rated.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e))
* Whoever is the acting PIC must be instrument current.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.57(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.57#p-61.57(c))
* Whoever is the sole manipulator of the flight controls can log PIC time.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(1)(i))
* Both pilots are _not_ required under IMC, so there is no provision for both pilots to log; only the sole manipulator of the flight controls can log that time as PIC.

## Discussion

The question as to whether the safety pilot can legally act as PIC is an important one with real consequences.
There may be limitations (e.g. insurance or rental agreements) that prevent the safety pilot from acting as PIC.

[14 CFR &sect;1.1 - Pilot in command](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Pilot%20in%20command))

> Has been designated as pilot in command before or during the flight

So pilot-in-command designation _can_ change during the flight, but this should be briefed so there is zero ambiguity about who is acting PIC at any point in the flight.

While a pilot can log PIC time and approaches in actual IMC with an instrument rated pilot who is acting PIC, this doesn't mean this is a good idea.

* Regardless of the above, if instrument currency is lost and the so-called "grace period" is past, an IPC is required.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.57(d)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.57#p-61.57(d)(1))
