# Flight Under Lost Comms

* If the radio fails while VFR, fly VFR and land as soon as practicable.
* The following rules determine the route and altitude that should be be flown should a radio failure happen in flight.
  * If flight needs to be continued IFR after losing communications, the following *route* should be flown (**AVEF**)
    * **A** - Assigned in last ATC clearance
    * **V** - Vectored
    * **E** - Expected from last ATC communication
    * **F** - Filed in flight plan
  * If flight needs to be continued IFR after losing communications, the *highest* of the following *altitude* should be flown (**MEA**) *for each route segment*
    * **M** - Minimum altitude for IFR operations
    * **E** - Expected from last ATC communication
    * **A** - Assigned in last ATC clearance
* See [14 CFR &sect;91.185 IFR operations: Two-way radio communications failure](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRef6e8c57f580cfd/section-91.185)
* If radio failure happens and clearance limit is the fix from which approach begins, start descent and approach as close as possible to EFC time, or to arrive at estimated arrival time from flight plan (or amended enroute.)
* If clearance limit is not a fix from which approach begins, leave the clearance limit at EFC time or arrival at the fix if no EFC time, and start approach to begin as close as possible to estimated time of arrival from flight plan (or amended enroute.)
* When comms are lost we are automatically cleared for any approach at our destination
* If you enter VMC try to stay in VMC
