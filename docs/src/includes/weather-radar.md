# Radar / Lightning Detection System

* Radar weather can be either onboard or ground-based, and transmitted to the aircraft.
  * Onboard weather radar systems
    * Onboard weather radar uses an adjustable aircraft mounted radar antenna to detect, in real time, weather phenomena near the aircraft.
    * You must be careful not to assume that the only cells in the area are the ones shown on the radar display.
    * When a cell is detected by an onboard weather radar system, that cell often absorbs or reflects all of the radio signals sent out by the radar system. This phenomenon, called attenuation, prevents the radar from detecting any additional cells that might lie behind the first cell.
  * Ground weather surveillance radar
    * Ground weather surveillance integrates weather information from many ground radar stations.
    * The weather information collected from many sources is then used to create a composite picture that covers large volumes of airspace.
    * These composite radar images can then be transmitted to aircraft equipped with weather data receivers.
  * Limitations
    * Weather radar does not detect most other kinds of hazardous weather such as fog, icing, and turbulence.
    * A second limitation of weather radar is that the earliest (cumulus) stage of a thunderstorm is usually free of precipitation and may not be detected by radar.
* Lightning detection
  * Can also come from source onboard the aircraft or on the ground
  * An onboard lightning detection system consists of a simple antenna and processing unit that senses electrical discharges in the atmosphere and attempts to determine which electromagnetic signals have the "signature" of lightning strikes.
  * See Stormscope and Strikefinder as examples
