# Airspeed

* **Indicated Airspeed (IAS)**
  * What the airspeed indicator says
* **Calibrated Airspeed (CAS)**
  * Indicated airspeed corrected for instrument and position error
  * These errors are due to pressure around the aircraft the static port, for example, does not measure free-stream static pressure perfectly, especially not across the whole range of flight conditions, flap settings, or a large angle of attack causing the free stream flow not to directly enter the pitot tube.
  * Calibrated airspeed is what the plane "sees"
  * When flying at sea level under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) conditions (15 degrees Celsius, 29.92 inHg, 0% humidity), calibrated airspeed is the same as true airspeed
* **Equivalent Airspeed (EAS)**
  * Calibrated airspeed corrected for compressibility effects
* **True Airspeed (TAS)**
  * Calibrated airspeed corrected for altitude and nonstandard temperature
  * For example, as altitude increases (and density decreases) the calibrated airspeed will tend to decrease (less dynamic pressure as measured by the pitot tube) even while true airspeed remains the same.
