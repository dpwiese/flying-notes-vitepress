# Departure Procedures

* Find Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STAR) and Departure Procedures (DP) in the [Digital Terminal Procedures Publication](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dtpp/)
* [AIM Section 2. Departure Procedures](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap5_section_2.html)
* **Departure Procedures (DP)**
  * The generic term for any kind of departure procedure
  * Then you have two basic types below, with two subtypes (graphical or textual)
* The two basic types are
  * **Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP)**
  * **Standard Instrument Departures (SID)**
* Departure procedure performance requirements are given in terms of feet per nautical mile.
  * To convert those to feet per minute, there is a chart in the back of the [Digital Terminal Procedures Publication (d-TPP)/Airport Diagrams](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dtpp/)

## Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP)

* Purely for obstacle clearance
* Graphical or textual
* ==ODPs may be flown without clearance==
* Generally designed to be available to the largest number of aircraft possible, so they might assume only a VOR receiver and low aircraft performance.
* See `T` in upside down triangle on approach plate for non-standard takeoff minimums or ODP
* **Textual ODPs**
  * Those listed in text format in the Takeoff Minimums and Obstacle Departure Procedures section of the Terminal Procedures Publication
  * They are usually fairly simple – turn to a heading, intercept a radial, etc.
* **Graphical ODPs**
  * Charted when it would be too complicated to describe them textually
  * They include the word (OBSTACLE) in the name, such as the `MONTROSE DEPARTURE (OBSTACLE)` out of `KMTJ`.
  * Note the rather tortured routing of the `MONTROSE DEPARTURE (OBSTACLE)` designed so that low performance airplanes can hopefully still meet the obstacle clearance requirements.
* ==Don't need to even fly ODPs, but ATC assumes you will and there's no reason not to==
* Climb to 400' AGL before turning
* Must climb at 200' per nm unless otherwise stated

## Standard Instrument Departures (SID)

* Exist predominantly for ATC reasons
* Reduces radio traffic and eases traffic flow
* They provide obstacle clearance as well
* Always graphical
* ==ATC clearance must be received prior to flying a SID==
* Given a name, such as the `ARSENAL FIVE DEPARTURE` out of `KHEF`
  * This departure is `ARSNL5`.
  * The particular *transition* is appended to the departure, for example the Martinsburg Transition would be `ARSNL5.MRB`.
* The design is based primarily on what is convenient for ATC traffic flow, not whether all airplanes can perform the procedure or not.
* Note they can have some pretty steep climb gradients as well as certain equipment requirements too.
* Climb to 400' AGL before turning
* Must climb at 200' per nm unless otherwise stated

## General Departure Notes

* Can decline DP
* If no departure procedure
  * ==Climb to 400' AGL and turn on course==
  * Must climb at least 200' per nm
  * Must be at least 35' AGL at departure end of runway

## Takeoff Minimums

* ==Under Part 91 there are no takeoff minimums except there are *performance minimums* for the departure you are assigned that you must meet.==
* If ATC assigns a departure with performance requirements you cannot meet, you must decline.
* FAA-designated standard minimums for Part 121 and 135
  * 1 statute mile (SM) visibility for single- and twin-engine aircraft
  * 1⁄2 SM for helicopters and aircraft with more than two engines
* Just because there are no takeoff minimums for Part 91, doesn't mean it's a good idea to take off in zero-zero weather
