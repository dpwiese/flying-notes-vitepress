# Logging Flight Time Without Flying

What time is loggable as flight time is defined in  [14 CFR &sect;1.1 - Flight Time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Flight%20time)):

> Flight time means:
>
> (1) Pilot time that commences when an aircraft moves under its own power for the purpose of flight and ends when the aircraft comes to rest after landing; or
>
> (2) For a glider without self-launch capability, pilot time that commences when the glider is towed for the purpose of flight and ends when the glider comes to rest after landing.

This regulation is cited repeatedly across references where clarification is sought regarding how to apply this definition.
Most of the clarification is around clarifying the "purpose of flight" such as in the [Johnson 2000](https://www.faa.gov/media/15511) which clarifies that when deicing procedures are part of an aircraft's journey from the origin gate to the final destination, the time spent deicing counts towards flight time.
Other clarifications like this exist.

However, another question when applying the above definition is whether flight time can be logged if a takeoff, and therefore a landing, is never made.
The arguments I have seen seem consider the first part of the definition in (1): that if an aicraft is moving for the purpose of flight that time is loggable, _regardless of whether a landing was actually made._

In attempt to get a better answer to this question, there are several letters of interpretation that offer some guidance.
Several excerpts are below.
Notably, there isn't a single interpretation that I have been able to find that relieves the condition of "after landing."
Emphasis added below.

[Johnson 2000](https://www.faa.gov/media/15511):

> Thus, we further conclude that flight time starts at the moment when the aircraft taxies under its own power from the gate to the de-icing pad, and ***flight time continues until the moment the aircraft comes to rest at the next point of landing.***

[Kania 2004](https://www.faa.gov/media/15381):

> In a situation in which a flight returns to the gate, for mechanical repair or other reason, such as additional freight or passengers, a critical inquiry is whether the air carrier requires the pilot to remain on board the airplane, because the mechanical repair or the on loading of passengers or cargo can be performed with all crewmembers and passengers on board. When the pilot must remain on board, this constitutes a delay that does not interrupt the accrual of flight time, because of the continuing "purpose of flight."
> In this situation, flight time starts when the aircraft first taxies under its own power from the gate, continues through the period of delay when the aircraft returns to the gate and in which the pilot must remain on board, ***and ends at the moment the aircraft comes to rest at the point of landing at the destination airport.***

> Another situation in which all flight time must be recorded is when a flight returns to the gate for mechanical reasons, the aircraft cannot be repaired, a replacement aircraft is used, ***and that aircraft does taxi, take off and make a landing at the destination airport.***
> In this situation, flight time accrues and must be counted.
> The flight time that must be counted is the time the first aircraft moves under its own power from the gate to the time of the return of the first aircraft to the gate, plus flight time from the time the replacement aircraft moves under its own power from the gate ***to the point where the replacement aircraft comes to rest at landing at the destination airport.***

[Lloyd 2007](https://www.faa.gov/media/15041):

> Flight time ends for any helicopter operation ***when the helicopter comes to rest after landing.***

[Johnson 2016](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/data/interps/2016/Johnson-ALPA_2016_Legal_Interpretation.pdf):

> Each of your scenarios presents a fact pattern ***where flight time has commenced and the aircraft has landed***, but the flightcrew is still required to remain on the aircraft.
> Consequently, the aircraft in each of your scenarios has not come to rest after landing and flight time would continue to accrue in each scenario.

## Commentary

It seems fairly obvious to me in all the letters I have been able to find, the FAA is clear that in every situation where flight time is accruing, that a landing has to have taken place.
There isn't a clear response in anything I have been able to find in response to a scenario that involves never flying, regardless of intention.
Much like the conversation around [14 CFR &sect;91.126(b)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.126#p-91.126(b)(1)) and circling approaches, the FAA's guidance has been consistent with the CFRs.
So, it's not unexpected that the FAA hasn't provided guidance that contradicts the [Flight Time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Flight%20time)) definition whereby logging ends at some other point in time other than after landing as is written.

In the context of flight duty and crew rest periods (which is the context for many of the above such letters clarifying what counts as flight time) the issue of a landing never being made (whether after changing planes or other significant ground delays) is somewhat a moot point.
The pilot(s) go home, and are able to rest during a time they would otherwise be flying.
Now, this doesn't mean that there aren't scenarios without ambiguity, but rather that these seem not to have been come up in practice and motivating the need for clarification.

A somewhat more common, albeit still rare scenario, is in scenarios having no crew rest requirements or otherwise how time should be logged when no associated landing ever occured.
One such scenario is a GA pilot who identifies an issue during the runup and aborts the flight and taxis back to the tidown whether this time counts as flight time.
I think the letters on this topic, all of which are consistent with [Flight Time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Flight%20time)) ending _after landing_ is no.

However, even accepting some ambiguity in this case one should consider whether logging such time when no flight ever occured is wise.
Consider that in the face of this ambiguity not every DPE or potential future employer is going to share the interpretation that logging such flight time is consistent with regulation.
And what might that say about someone so desperate to log time that they need to try to capture some tiny fraction of percent of time despite never having flown.
