# Recreational and Sport Pilot Endorsements

* Recreational and sport pilot certificates are heavily restricted compared to a private pilot certificate
* Restrictions include how far one can fly from origin airport, restricts to E and G airpsace, altitude restrictions, horsepower restrictions, passenger carrying restrictions
* While these certificates offer an easier path to a pilot certificate than a private pilot, I don't think the marginally easier training makes up for how restricted they are
* It is unlikely I will ever give this training or grant these endorsements, so they are not covered here
