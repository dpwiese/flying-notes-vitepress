## Double Dipping

::: tip
The safest way to credit instrument training received while working towards an instrument rating towards the requirements of [14 CFR &sect;61.129](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-F/section-61.129) is to ensure the training satisfies the commercial requirements and note in the logbook entry that the training received was in accordance with [14 CFR &sect;61.129](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-F/section-61.129).

## Flying for Hire

### Introduction

A commercial pilot's license does not mean you can just buy a plane and start charging money to fly people around.
Rather it's quite restrictive.
First, you will be considered a *carrier* if you are willing to take payment to transport people or proerty from place to place as described in [FAA-AC-120-12A Private Carriage Versus Common Carriage Of Persons or Property](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647), with a few exceptions.
The carriage of passengers may fall under *common carriage* or *private carriage*, which are discussed below, but in either case an air carrier certificate is required.

Basically, there isn't practically anything an owner of a small plane can do to charge to carry passengers.
Rather, you'll get a job with a company / operator of a plane that will need to take care of the air carrier certificate if needed.
And really the takeaway here is that if, as a commercial pilot, you are faced with an opportunity where there is any uncertainty as to whether it is legal or not, go check out 14 CFR.

### Definitions

* **[Operate (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Operate))**
  * With respect to aircraft, means use, cause to use, or authorize to use aircraft.
* **[Operational control (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Operational%20control))**
  * With respect to a flight, means the exercise of authority over initiating, conducting, or terminating a flight.
* **[Commercial operator (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Commercial%20operator))**
  * Means a person who, for compensation or hire, engages in the carriage by aircraft in air commerce of persons or property, other than as an air carrier or foreign air carrier or under the authority of Part 375 of this title. Where it is doubtful that an operation is for "compensation or hire", the test applied is whether the carriage by air is merely incidental to the person's other business or is, in itself, a major enterprise for profit.
* **[Air Carrier (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Air%20carrier))**
  * Means a person who undertakes directly by lease, or other arrangement, to engage in air transportation.
* **Common carriage**
  * A carrier becomes a common carrier when it "holds itself out" to the public, or to a segment of the public as willing to furnish transportation within the limits of its facilities to any person who wants it.
  * There are four elements in defining common carriage:
      1. A holding out of a willingness to
      2. Transport persons or property
      3. From place to place
      4. For compensation
  * [FAA-AC-120-12A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647)
* **Private carriage**
  * Carriage for hire which does not involve "holding out" is private carriage.
  * [FAA-AC-120-12A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647)
