    * Except that a student pilot may make solo training flights from Haines, Gustavus, or Juneau, Alaska, to White Horse, Yukon, Canada, and return over the province of British Columbia;
  * With a flight or surface visibility of less than 3 statute miles during daylight hours or 5 statute miles at night
  * When the flight cannot be made with visual reference to the surface
  * In a manner contrary to any limitations placed in the pilot's logbook by an authorized instructor
  * A student pilot may not act as a required pilot flight crewmember on any aircraft for which more than one pilot is required by the type certificate of the aircraft or regulations under which the flight is conducted, except when receiving flight training from an authorized instructor on board an airship, and no person other than a required flight crewmember is carried on the aircraft
* CFI endorses the student logbook for the specific make and model for the aircraft to be flown, good for 90 days.
* With proper documentations, as mentioned above, solo PIC flight can be completed to specific destinations or areas by the student pilot.

  * Subparagraph (i) of [14 CFR &sect;61.1(b) Cross-country time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.1#p-61.1(b)(Cross-country%20time)) states the following

    > includes a landing at a point other than the point of departure

  * Subparagraph (ii) say that for the purposes of meeting aeronautical experience requirements for a private pilot certificate the cross-country flight must include a point of landing more than 50 nm from the point of departure
  * This seems to mean that student pilots must carry their logbook on any flight that involves a landing at a point other than the point of departure, even if such a flight cannot count towards aeronautical experience requirements for a private pilot certificate
  * *It is probably best for student pilots to just get in the habit of keeping their logbook in their flight bag so it is always with them when they fly.*

## Notes

* Student pilot certificates never expire
* Have student pilot apply for student pilot certificate via IACRA right away
* Student pilot certificate is physical plastic card just like any other pilot certificate
