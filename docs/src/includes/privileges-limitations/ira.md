## Privileges and Limitations

* **==Flight under IFR or in weather less than VFR==**
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e) Instrument rating](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e))
    * *"No person may act as pilot in command of a civil aircraft under IFR or in weather conditions less than the minimums prescribed for VFR flight unless that person holds ... instrument rating on that person's pilot certificate."*
    * Goodish 2008 letter states that even *filing* an IFR flight plan, even without planning to actually accept an IFR clearance in association with the flight plan, is intent to violate [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e))
* **==Flight in Class A airspace==**
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.135 Operations in Class A airspace](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.135)
    * *"Each person operating an aircraft in Class A airspace must conduct that operation under instrument flight rules (IFR)."*
* **==Special VFR at night==**
  * Technically it is between sunset and sunrise
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.157(b)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.157#p-91.157(b)(4))
    * *"The person being granted the ATC clearance meets the applicable requirements for* ***instrument flight*** *under part 61 of this chapter."*

### Adding Instrument Rating to Commercial Pilot Certificate

* **==Passengers for hire on cross countries longer than 50 nm or at night==**
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.133(b)(1) Commercial pilot privileges and limitations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-F/section-61.133)
    * *"The carriage of passengers for hire in airplanes on cross-country flights in excess of 50 nautical miles* ***or*** *at night is prohibited."*

### 14 CFR &sect;91.173

* [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e)) states that a pilot needs an instrument rating to operate in weather conditions less than VFR.
* [14 CFR &sect;91.173](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRef6e8c57f580cfd/section-91.173) says that (and let's assume the pilot is instrument rated and therefor satisfies [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e))) that the pilot only needs to be on an IFR flight plan and receive clearance in _controlled airspace_.
* Operations in uncontrolled airspace under IMC without a clearance or instrument rating may violate [14 CFR &sect;91.13 Careless or reckless operation](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-A/section-91.13)
