    * ATC basically wants to know if we are making a deliberate power change
  * ==**R** - Reaching a holding fix==
    * Time and altitude
    * Crossing the holding fix outbound as part of our entry procedure
  * ==**V** - VFR on-top altitude changes==
  * ==**E** - ETA change==
    * Of more than +/- 2 minutes
    * *In non-radar environment*
  * ==**L** - Leaving a holding fix==
  * ==**O** - Outer marker inbound==
