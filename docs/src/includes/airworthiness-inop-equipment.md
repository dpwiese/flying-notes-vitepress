# Inoperative Equipment Overview

* When thinking about what equipment is required first think of [14 CFR &sect;91.7 - Civil aircraft airworthiness](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-A/section-91.7) that says:

  > No person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in an airworthy condition. The pilot in command of a civil aircraft is responsible for determining whether that aircraft is in condition for safe flight

* So if you have any reason to think the aircraft is not safe to fly due to some inoperative equipment, don't fly it.
* Regulations should be a floor for safety not a ceiling.

* **Minimum Equipment List (MEL)**
  * A minimum equipment list is a list of equipment approved by the manufacturer and the FAA, by which you may legally operate a flight with inoperative equipment.
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.213](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.213)
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205)
  * Requirements below are when an aircraft needs an MEL
  * No aircraft can fly with inoperative equipment unless it has an approved minimum equipment list (MEL)
  * *Exception:*
    * Non-turbine planes (and some other aircraft) as long as the inoperative equipment is not required by [14 CFR &sect;91.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205)
    * And not required by type certificate or Airworthiness Directive (AD)
    * Marked as "INOP"
  * If the aircraft does not have an MEL can follow [14 CFR &sect;91.213](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.213) which says for non-turbine planes (and some other aircraft) as long as the inoperative equipment is not required by [14 CFR &sect;91.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205) and not required by type certificate or Airworthiness Directive (AD) it can be marked as "INOP" and the aircraft can still be flown.
  * If missing any items in MEL must get authorization from FSDO
* **Kind of Operations (Equipment) List (KOL or KOEL)**
  * Indicates equipment required for airworthiness during the kinds of operations (e.g. VFR/IFR, day/night)
    * The Cessna 172SP, for example, which contains a KOEL in Section 2 of the POH indicates that strobes are required for all flight conditions.
  * If our aircraft has a KOEL it will be in the POH?
* **Comprehensive Equipment List (CEL)**
  * For example in the weight and balance section of C172SP POH
  * It is a comprehensive list of equipment in the aircraft and identifies those items that are required by CFRs for FAA certification
  * Is this actually any different than the minimum required by FAA? Or is Cessna imposing additional requirements beyond the FAA with this list?
  * Is this the same as KOEL?
* **Supplemental Type Certificate (STC)**
  * FAA authorization to modify aircraft (e.g. install new avionics)
  * Might come with additional requirements, e.g. keep PFD manual in plane
* This has interesting discussion about what equipment needs to be working in particular on intermittently working equipment [Minimum Equipment: What Has to be Working?](https://www.cirruspilots.org/Publications/Articles/minimum-equipment-what-has-to-be-working)
* A good way to approach required equipment on the aircraft is to think through a hypothetical situation of preflighting an aircraft prior to a flight, finding a piece of equipment inoperative, and then determining whether or not the aircraft can still be flown with said equipment inoperative.

# Determining Airworthiness

* The following flowchart captures most of the questions that need to be answered in this situation.

![Required equipment flow chart when operating _without_ and MEL. Reference unknown, likely [8900.1](https://drs.faa.gov/browse/ORDER_8900.1/doctypeDetails). See also [FAA-AC-91-67A Minimum Equipment Requirements for General Aviation Operations Under FAR Part 91](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_91-67A.pdf)](/img/minimum-equipment-flow-chart.jpg){width=500 border=true}

* The following list is similar to the questions in the flowchart.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.213 - Inoperative instruments and equipment](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.213)
* The order in which these questions are asked does not matter.
  1. ==**Does the plane have an MEL?**==
      * Minimum equipment list, approved by FAA
      * General aviation planes will almost certainly not have an MEL
  2. ==**Does the plane have a KOEL (kinds of equipment list)?**==
      * G1000/nav com III POHs do, start there (section 2 POH, operating limitations)
  3. ==**Does the plane have a CEL (comprehensive equipment list)?**==
      * 172R/S/M/N/P (section 6 POH, weight and balance, R required for flight, S standard)
  4. ==**Is it required by 14 CFR &sect;91?**==
      * [14 CFR &sect;91.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205), [14 CFR &sect;91.207](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.207), etc.?
      * A+TOMATOFLAMES, FLAPS, etc.
  5. ==**Is it required by Airworthines Directive?**==
  6. ==**Is it required by STC?**==
  7. ==**Finally, is it required to fly safely?**==
      * See [14 CFR &sect;91.7](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-A/section-91.7)
* If it legal to fly with the inoperative equipment, it must be placarded and either removed or deactivated, if it is removed, a new weight and balance might need to be computed depending on the weight of the part.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.213(d)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.213#p-91.213(d)(3))
  * [FAA-AC-91-67A Minimum Equipment Requirements for General Aviation Operations Under FAR Part 91](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_91-67A.pdf)

    > Deactivation. When an item is "deactivated" or "secured," or both, the specified item must be put into an acceptable condition for safe flight. Deactivation may involve more than simply turning off a system switch, which does not remove power from the system. Deactivation may involve pulling and securing the circuit breaker and/or removing the equipment. Deactivation of an inoperative system is not preventive maintenance as described in part 43 appendix A. Regardless of the method of deactivation, a person authorized to approve the aircraft for return to service under &sect; 43.7 must make the maintenance record entry required by &sect; 43.9. No person may operate the aircraft without the entry required by &sect; 43.9.

  * The safest interpretation of this is that deactivation is _not_ preventative maintenance and therefore not something the pilot can do.
  * However, the references below may offer other interpretations that might be applied in the case of pulling and securing a circuit breaker in order to deactivate a piece of equpiment.
  * Specifically, that the act of pulling a circuit breaker, like adding oil to the engine, doesn't even rise to the level of preventative maintentance.
    * [Coleal 2009](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2009/Coleal-Bombardier%20Learjet_2009_Legal_Interpretation.pdf)

      > Many preventive maintenance tasks are listed in 14 C.F.R. part 43, appendix A, paragraph (c).
      > The paragraph sets forth in 32 numbered subparagraphs items the FAA has determined to be preventive maintenance.
      > Even though the introductory text of subparagraph (c) states that "[p]reventive maintenance is limited to the following work ...." (emphasis added), in view of the broader definition of preventive maintenance in section 1.1, we believe that such limitation 'is not controlling.
      > Similarly, for the same reason, we also believe that the following sentence in Advisory Circular 43-12A, Preventive Maintenance (which was referenced in Mr. Hernandez's letter), is overly restrictive
      > That sentence, found in Paragraph 3(b)(l), states: "If a task or maintenance function does not appear in the list, it is not preventive maintenance."
      > As with the other paragraphs of Appendix A (i.e., on major repairs and major alterations), the lists are better viewed as examples of the tasks in each category-they cannot be considered all-inclusive.
      > There are, no doubt, many "simple or minor preservation operations [tasks]" and many "replacement[s] of small standard parts not involving complex assembly operations" performed daily, especially on small general aviation aircraft, that the agency would consider to be preventive maintenance, though they are not included in the 32 listed items.

    * [Hochberg 2016](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2016/Hochberg_2016_Legal_Interpretation.pdf)
      * Referenced above in [Pilot Performed Preventative Maintenance](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#pilot-performed-preventive-maintenance)
      * In the context of pilots deactivating inoperative systems (e.g. via pulling and securing a circuit breaker) this letter offers some guidance related to things pilots _can_ do which do not even rise to the level of preventative maintenance.
      * In the context of this letter, it seems a reasonable position to take that pulling and securing a circuit breaker is the same level as adding oil, and therefore while _not_ preventative maintenance something the pilot _can_ legall do.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.213(d)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.213#p-91.213(d)(3)) also says, "_if_ deactivation of the inoperative instrument or equipment involves maintenance" implying that deactivation may be possible that does _not_ involve maintenance.
  * Finally, remember about Advisory Circulars from the [AIM](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap0_cfr.html):

    > Advisory Circulars ‐ The FAA issues Advisory Circulars (AC) to inform the aviation public in a systematic way of nonregulatory material. Unless incorporated into a regulation by reference, the contents of an advisory circular are not binding on the public.

## Aside: a Single Broken Strobe Light

* Regarding equipment required by [14 CFR &sect;91.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205), it is interesting to note that [14 CFR &sect;91.205(b)(11)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205#p-91.205(b)(11)) says, regarding anticollision light system:

  > In the event of failure of **any light of the anticollision light system**, operation of the aircraft may continue to a location where repairs or replacement can be made.

* So this is why according to the C172SP KOEL that Strobes are required during all flight conditions.
* See also [Letts 2017 Legal Interpretation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2017/Letts_2017_Legal_Interpretation.pdf).

## Aside: Altimeter Accuracy

* ***Altimeter accuracy requirements +/- 75 ft. for IFR. For VFR not explicitly stated, but it's up to PIC to determine the aircraft is in a safe condition for flight.***
* Accuracy requirements of altimeter [AIM 7-2-3 Altimeter Errors](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_2.html#$paragraph7-2-3):

  > If the difference from the known field elevation and the altitude read from the altimeter is plus or minus 75 feet or greater, the accuracy of the altimeter is questionable and the problem should be referred to an appropriately rated repair station for evaluation and possible correction.

* From [14 CFR &sect;91.217(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.217):
  * *The difference between the automatic reporting output and the altitude displayed at the altimeter shall not exceed 125 feet.*
