# ADS-B

::: warning ADS-B
A surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation or other sensors and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked.
:::

* ADS-B uses plane's WAAS GPS and broadcasts information to other planes and ground stations.
* Ground stations compile and rebroadcast received information.
* This is known as ADS-B Out.
* ADS-B In is the capability for other planes to receive this information as traffic, as well as weather information.
* Acronym
  * Automatic - no pilot input required
  * Dependendent - requires positon input, e.g. WAAS GPS
  * Surveilance - provides aircrafts location, direction, and climb/descent indication
  * Broadcast - broadcasts the surveilance information to be seen by others
* Components of ADS-B In
  * **Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B)**
    * Provides traffic information to planes with ADS-B receivers.
    * The traffic includes that which is not broadcasting its own output via ADS-B, because it's able to use radar data and conventional transponder data to understand where aircraft are.
  * **Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B)**
    * Provides NEXRAD graphical weather in (for example in G1000).
    * Also provides info on SUA and TFRs.

## Requirements

* ADS-B is required in:
  * Class A, B, and C airspace.
  * Class E airspace at or above 10,000 feet MSL.
    * Excluding airspace at and below 2,500 feet AGL.
  * Within 30 nautical miles of a Class B primary airport (the Mode C veil).
  * Above the ceiling and within the lateral boundaries of Class B or Class C airspace up to 10,000 feet.
  * Class E airspace over the Gulf of Mexico, at and above 3,000 feet MSL, within 12 nm of the U.S. coast.
