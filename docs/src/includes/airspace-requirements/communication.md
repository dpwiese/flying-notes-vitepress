# Two-Way Radio Communication

* ***Two-way radio communication requirement is met when ATC uses your aircraft ID (tail number or callsign).***
* For example, if ATC says "aircraft calling standby" this does *not* constitute two-way communication.
* If ATC says "N12345 standby" that does.
  * See the note in [AIM 3-2-5(b)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-5)
    > If the controller responds to a radio call with, “[aircraft callsign] standby,” radio communications have been established and the pilot can enter the Class D airspace.
  * See also [JO 7110.65BB 7-8-4](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap7_section_8.html#P2I398JACK)
* [14 CFR &sect;91.129(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.129#p-91.129(c)(1)) says:

    > Each person must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility (including foreign ATC in the case of foreign airspace designated in the United States) providing air traffic services prior to entering that airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within that airspace.

* Communication with TRACON or Center on flight following does not satisfy the requirement to fly through Class D, as neither of these is the Class D tower, which is the facility controlling that airspace.
* However [JO 7110.65AA 2−1−16(b)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap2_section_1.html#C8I3b6JACK) says:

    > Coordinate with the appropriate control tower for transit authorization when you are providing radar traffic advisory service to an aircraft that will enter another facility's airspace.

    > NOTE - The pilot is not expected to obtain his/her own authorization through each area when in contact with a radar facility.

* [AIM 3-2-1(d)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-1) says:

    > VFR Requirements. It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that ATC clearance or radio communication requirements are met prior to entry into Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace. The pilot retains this responsibility when receiving ATC radar advisories. (See 14 CFR Part 91.)

* Therefore, there is some ambiguity about whose responsibility it is
* This was clarified in the [Air Traffic Procedures Bulletin October 2017](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/atpb_october_2017.pdf)
* This bulletin provides guidance to controllers as to how they can help coordinate
* The [Granby 2006 Legal Interpretation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2006/Granby_2006_Legal_Interpretation.pdf) additionally states that, with respect to C airspace, TRACON is *the* controlling agency
  * *Note: can find a list of FAA Legal interpretation letters at the [FAA Regulations Division Legal Interpretations & Chief Counsel's Opinions](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/) page*
* ***Ultimately, it is the pilot's job to check when on flight following whether a switchover to tower is required before flying through C or D airspace, or whether ATC has already coordinated.***
