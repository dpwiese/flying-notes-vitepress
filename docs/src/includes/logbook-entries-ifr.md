# Logbook Entries or Training Records for Instrument Flight / Instruction

* [14 CFR &sect;61.51 Pilot logbooks](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51) requires pilots to log training time and aeronautical experience used to meet the requirements for an instrument rating and the recent flight experience required by [14 CFR &sect;61.57 Recent flight experience: Pilot in command](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57)
* *In actual instrument conditions* there is no way for two *pilots* to both log PIC time
  * Per [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e)) only someone with an instrument rating can *act as PIC* in weather less than VFR.
    * However, just like someone in simulated instrument conditions that is the sole manipulator of the flight controls can *log PIC time* while their safety pilot is the *acting PIC* the same applies to actual instrument conditions.
    * The difference in actual IMC though is that the acting PIC *cannot log PIC* while the non-instrument rated pilot is the sole manipulator of the flight controls (and therefore logging PIC)

* *In simulated instrument conditions* both pilots can *log* PIC time when the pilot (under foggles) is the sole manipulator of the flight controls
  * The agreement here is that the safety pilot is *acting PIC*, and by [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(iii)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(1)(iii)) the safety pilot is a required crewmember, so they get to log PIC time
  * The pilot under foggles is the sole manipulator of the flight controls, so by [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(1)(i)) they can log PIC time
  * A safety pilot is required when flying under foggles
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.109(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.109#p-91.109(c))
  * Safety pilot needs a current flight review to act as PIC
  * Whether or not the safety pilot is acting PIC they _do_ need a medical to serve as a required crewmember
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.3(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.3#p-61.3(c)(1))
  * High performance / complex endorsements required only for the safety pilot to _act_ as PIC but not to serve as safety pilot
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.31(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.31#p-61.31(e))
  * If not acting as PIC, the safety pilot can log SIC time
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(f)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.51#p-61.51(f)(2))

    * Glenn 2009
    * Gebhart 2009
    * Creech 2013
* Instrument flight time (simulated or actual) can be logged when the pilot operates aircraft solely by reference to instruments
* A student pilot *cannot log* PIC time whether under foggles or not, because the sole manipulator of the flight controls requires the pilot be rated for the aircraft they are flying, which a student pilot is not
* Safety pilot needs to have valid medical or BasicMed
  * Essentially, they have to be legal enough to operate the aircraft themselves with a passenger
* CFII can log PIC time regardless of meteorological conditions when acting as as instructor
  * See [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(3))
