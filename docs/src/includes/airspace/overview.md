# Overview

* Airspace is divided into two primary categories: controlled and uncontrolled
* There are other airspace classifications which exist within either controlled or uncontrolled airspace
* The primary objective when it comes to airspace is understand the conditions under which we can legally fly through a given airspace
  * These conditions include visibility and cloud clearance requirements, equipment requirements, the use of a flight plan, and more
* There are many different types of airspace, some of which are found in only certain parts of the country (e.g. Alaska, Washington D.C.)

::: info NOTE
It is important to remember and understand the rules which apply to the more commonly encountered types of airspace, and review charts, FAA publications, and other information when planning a flight into or through an airspace type you have not yet encountered.
