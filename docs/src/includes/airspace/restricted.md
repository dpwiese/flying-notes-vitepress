* Seperates civilian traffic from potentially hazardous military activities
* ==Requires permission from ATC ("the controlling agency") to fly through (when active)==
  * Who is the controlling agency?
* When flying IFR, don't really need to worry about it. ATC will either allow you to operate in the restricted area without an explicit clearance, our route you around it. See [AIM 3-4-3(b)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_4.html#$paragraph3-4-3).
* ATC can confirm if hot & can provide crossing
