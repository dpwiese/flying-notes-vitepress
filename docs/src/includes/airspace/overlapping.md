# Overlapping Airspace

* As an example, see some airspace around `KBFI` and `KSEA` -- there is D airspace that extends upwards into B.
* See [14 CFR &sect;71.9 - Overlapping airspace designations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-71/section-71.9):

  > When overlapping airspace designations apply to the same airspace, the operating rules associated with the more restrictive airspace designation apply.

* See also [AIM 3-1-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_1.html#$paragraph3-1-3) which also clarifies what is meant by the relative level of "restrictiveness" of the airspace classes.
