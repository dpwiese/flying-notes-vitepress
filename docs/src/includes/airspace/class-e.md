# Class E

* [AIM 3-2-6](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-6)
* Any controlled airspace that is not A-D
* Class E airspace below 14,500 feet MSL is charted on Sectional, Terminal, and IFR Enroute Low Altitude charts.
* *So technically the default is G up to 14,500 unless otherwise charted*
* ==However, with very few exceptions (see class G airspace below) class E is charted to start at either 700' or 1200' AGL==
  * ==So basically the default is that E starts at 1200' AGL except where charted to start at 700' AGL, or where shown to *not* to start at 1200' AGL.==
  * This can be seen along the US border, where it shows the start of E at 1,200'
* 700/1200 ft AGL â€“ 18,000 ft MSL (A), up to 12 nm off US coast
* "1200 ft, except where the elephant steps"
* VFR chart Colors
  * To surface: dashed magenta
  * 700 ft floor: ombre magenta
  * 1200 ft floor: ombre blue
    * Note: ombre is a French word meaning shaded, where one hue blends to another
* Weather, Aircraft, Pilot Requirements
