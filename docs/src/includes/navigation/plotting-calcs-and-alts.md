* Time, distance, fuel calculations
  * Make sure to plan route to avoid terrain and certain airspace
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.151 Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.151)
  * Personal minimum should be higher than these
  * Consider winds, visibility, communications, radar service (flight following) when planning altitude
* Terrain, navaids
* Services available at stops
* **VFR cruising altitudes**
  * ==Required to be maintained when flying more than 3,000 feet AGL (and less than 18,000 MSL) based on *magnetic course*.==
  * See [14 CFR &sect;91.159](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.159)
  * ==Use acronym **ONE - Odd North / East**==
    * East: odd feet + 500 (e.g. 3,500, 5,500)
    * West: even feet + 500 (e.g. 4,500, 6,500)
* No person may operate any portable electronic device on any aircraft while it is operated under IFR.
