* **Latitude**
  * Horizontal lines that run around the globe where the north-south distance is constant
* **Longitude**
  * Vertical lines that specify east-west coordinate
  * Together longitude and latitude give coordinates on the globe
  * Specified in degrees, where each degree is further divided into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, where seconds can be decimals
* **Time zones**
  * Use of GMT / UTC or "Zulu" time
* **True** vs **Magnetic** coordinates
* **Heading**
  * Direction the airplane is pointed
* **Course**
  * Planned direction of flight
* **Track**
  * Actual direction plane is flying
* **Magnetic Variation**
  * Also called magnetic declination
  * Angle between true north and magnetic north
  * Easterly vs. Westerly variation
  * ==Variation can be thought of as where you would end up if you tried to follow your compass to true north==
    * For example, in the northeastern United States where the variation is *westerly*, if you followed your compass north you would end up *west* of true north.
    * I find this easier than the memory aid "west is best, east is least" as it doesn't help remember if it applies when converting from or to magnetic direction
  * This is encountered mostly in flight planning, where courses are initially defined by and most readily read from charts as a true course
    * These then need to be converted to magnetic course to be able to fly with a compass
* **Isogonic line**
  * Magnetic variation is constant
* **Agonic line**
  * No magnetic variation - compass points to true north
* **Magnetic Deviation**
  * Compass error caused by local magnetic field around airplane
  * Dependent on which direction the aircraft is facing
* **Bearing**
  * Angle between two lines, such as between aircraft's track and VOR radial
* **Map projections**
  * How to display a "round" globe on a flat piece of paper
  * Azimuthal Projection – sphere onto a plane (Earth)
  * Conic Projection – map fitted to a cone
  * Cylindrical Projection – projects entire world map at once
  * When measuring true course on a line drawn on a sectional chart, measure the course angle at the midpoint of the line
* **Standard Sea Level Pressure**
  * 29.92" Hg
* **Standard Sea Level Temperature**
  * 15 &#176;C
