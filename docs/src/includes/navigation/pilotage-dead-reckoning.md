# Pilotage

* Navigation by reference to landmarks or checkpoints
* For example, following a highway
* Becomes difficult in low visibility or in areas that lack prominent features
* Use prominent checkpoints that can be seen
* Consider checkpoints as boundaries

# Dead reckoning

* Navigation solely by means of computations based on time, airspeed, distance, and direction.
* For example, calculating wind correction and speed, and figuring out what approximately southerly heading would be required to fly from `KHEF` to `KRIC`.

# Using Pilotage and Dead Reckoning

* Pilotage and dead reckoning are distinct skills but are applied together to successfully navigate
* Upon reaching a particular point along the route, dead reckoning is used to set the initial heading
* Pilotage is used to adjust the heading as needed to arrive at the next desired waypoint
  * For example, `KEDU` to `KCIC` (buttes and grain elevator)
