# Pilotage and Dead Reckoning

* **Pilotage**
  * Navigation by reference to landmarks or checkpoints
  * For example, following a highway
  * Becomes difficult in low visibility or in areas that lack prominent features
  * Use prominent checkpoints that can be seen
  * Consider checkpoints as boundaries
* **Dead reckoning**
  * Navigation solely by means of computations based on time, airspeed, distance, and direction.
  * For example, calculating wind correction and speed, and figuring out what approximately southerly heading would be required to fly from `KHEF` to `KRIC`.
* Pilotage and dead reckoning combine well, using visual references as checkpoints with dead reckoning between
  * For example, `KEDU` to `KCIC` (buttes and grain elevator)
