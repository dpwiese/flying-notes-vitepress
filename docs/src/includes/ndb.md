* A low or medium frequency radio beacon transmits nondirectional signals whereby the pilot of an aircraft properly equipped can determine bearings and "home" on the station
* These facilities normally operate in a frequency band of 190 to 535 kilohertz (kHz)
* Information from an NDB is displayed to the pilot on an Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) of which there are four kinds
  * Fixed-card ADF also known as the relative bearing indicator (RBI)
  * Rotatable compass-card ADF
  * Radio magnetic indicator (RMI) (with either one needle or dual needle)
* All radio beacons, except compass locators, transmit a continuous three-letter identification in code, except during voice transmissions
* NDBs have one advantage over the VOR in that low or medium frequencies are not affected by line-of-sight
  * If the aircraft is within the range of the station, the signals can be received regardless of altitude
* One of the disadvantages that should be considered when using low frequency (LF) for navigation is that LF signals are very susceptible to electrical disturbances, such as lightning.
* The ADF needle points TO the station, regardless of aircraft heading or position.
