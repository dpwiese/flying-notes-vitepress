# Pilot and controller responsibilities to include tower, en route control, and clearance void times

* [FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf)
  * Chapter 10: IFR Flight
* File IFR flight plan
* IFR departure
  * Release time
    * May not depart prior to this time
  * Clearance void time
    * Clearance void if not airborne by this time

# Correct and timely copying of an ATC clearance

* Obtaining a clearance
  * Clearance delivery
    * The `KHEF` clearance delivery frequency goes directly to Potomac Approach when the tower is closed so we can get clearances from them
    * ==When calling for clearance at an airport where ground and clearance share the same frequency, in call-up refer to them as "clearance" when calling for clearance==
      * This allows the person receiving the transmission to more easily switch context to clearance delivery from their ground controller duties
  * Ground control
  * RCO/GCO
  * Flight Service
  * ATC
* Use the **CRAFT** acronym when copying IFR clearance
  * **C** - Clearance limit ("cleared to")
  * **R** - Route
  * **A** - Altitude
  * **F** - Frequency
  * **T** - Transponder
* If no further clearance is received, then 3 minutes prior to arriving at clearance limit slow to holding speed
* ==Suggest that students fill out as much of the expected CRAFT as possible before calling for clearance==
* Pop-up IFR clearance

## How to Receive a Clearance

* Getting IFR clearance before T/O
  * Towered airport
    * Specific clearance delivery frequency e.g. KBED 121.85
    * Ground e.g. KOWD 121.8
  * Non-towered airport
    * Center/approach control (via radio)
    * Center/approach control (via phone, e.g. Oakland Center/Norcal Approach 1-310-725-3300)
    * Flight service (radio or telephone)

* [Aviation StackExchange: How do you request a "pop up" IFR clearance?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1361/how-do-you-request-a-pop-up-ifr-clearance)

# Ability to comply with the clearance

* Make sure to copy the clearance correctly
  * The readback should ensure this is the case
* Make sure to have information needed to adhere to the clearance
  * Taxi diagram
  * Departure procedure
* Set up FMS according to the clearance

# Correct and timely read-back of an ATC clearance, using standard phraseology

* See above

# Correct interpretation of an ATC clearance and, when necessary, request for clarification, verification, or change

* See above

# Setting of communication and navigation frequencies in compliance with an ATC clearance

* Departure frequency given with CRAFT clearance
* Check frequencies before takeoff
* "No dead frequencies"
* Suggest using COM1 for "air" frequencies and COM2 for "ground" frequencies
