# Pilot and controller responsibilities to include tower, en route control, and clearance void times

* [FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf)
  * Chapter 10: IFR Flight
* File IFR flight plan
* IFR departure
  * Release time
    * May not depart prior to this time
  * Clearance void time
    * Clearance void if not airborne by this time
* ==Required reports (**MARVELOUS VFR C500**)==
  * ==**M** - Missed approach==
  * ==**A** - Airspeed==
    * +/- 10 kts or 5% of filed TAS (whichever greater)
    * ATC basically wants to know if we are making a deliberate power change
  * ==**R** - Reaching a holding fix==
    * Time and altitude
    * Crossing the holding fix outbound as part of our entry procedure
  * ==**V** - VFR on-top altitude changes==
  * ==**E** - ETA change==
    * Of more than +/- 2 minutes
    * *In non-radar environment*
  * ==**L** - Leaving a holding fix==
  * ==**O** - Outer marker inbound==
    * *In non-radar environment*
    * Outer marker indicates final approach fix for non-precision approach
  * ==**U** - Unforecast weather==
    * Especially icing, turbulence, wind
  * ==**S** - Safety of flight==
  * ==**V** - Vacating an altitude or flight level==
  * ==**F** - FAF inbound==
    * *In non-radar environment*
  * ==**R** - Radio or navigation failure==
  * ==**C** - Compulsory reporting points==
    * *In non-radar environment*
  * ==**500** - Failure to maintain at least 500 FPM climb or descent==
* ==How to report one of the above (**PTA PT P**)==
  * **P** - Point
  * **T** - Time
  * **A** - Altitude
  * **P** - Point
  * **T** - Time
  * **P** - Point
  * For example
    * *=="Potomac Approach, Skyventures 124 is over CSN at 4000 feet 30 minutes after the hour, expect BRV at 45 minutes after the hour, then FAK"==*
* Position reports
  * Position reports are required over each compulsory reporting point along the route being flown
    * Shown on the chart as a solid triangle
  * Along direct routes, reports are required of all IFR flights over each point used to define the route of flight
  * Position reports should include the following items:
      1. Identification
      2. Position
      3. Time
      4. Altitude
      5. Type of flight plan
      6. Estimated time of arrival (ETA) and name of next reporting point
      7. The name only of the next succeeding reporting point along the route of flight
      8. Remarks

# Correct and timely copying of an ATC clearance

* Obtaining a clearance
  * Clearance delivery
    * The `KHEF` clearance delivery frequency goes directly to Potomac Approach when the tower is closed so we can get clearances from them
    * ==When calling for clearance at an airport where ground and clearance share the same frequency, in call-up refer to them as "clearance" when calling for clearance==
      * This allows the person receiving the transmission to more easily switch context to clearance delivery from their ground controller duties
  * Ground control
  * RCO/GCO
  * Flight Service
  * ATC
* Use the **CRAFT** acronym when copying IFR clearance
  * **C** - Clearance limit ("cleared to")
  * **R** - Route
  * **A** - Altitude
  * **F** - Frequency
  * **T** - Transponder
* If no further clearance is received, then 3 minutes prior to arriving at clearance limit slow to holding speed
* ==Suggest that students fill out as much of the expected CRAFT as possible before calling for clearance==
* Pop-up IFR clearance

## How to Receive a Clearance

* Getting IFR clearance before T/O
  * Towered airport
    * Specific clearance delivery frequency e.g. KBED 121.85
    * Ground e.g. KOWD 121.8
  * Non-towered airport
    * Center/approach control (via radio)
    * Center/approach control (via phone, e.g. Oakland Center/Norcal Approach 1-310-725-3300)
    * Flight service (radio or telephone)

## Popup IFR Clearance

* [Aviation StackExchange: Does a request for a Pop-Up IFR clearance constitute filing a flight plan?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/25709/does-a-request-for-a-pop-up-ifr-clearance-constitute-filing-a-flight-plan)
* [Aviation StackExchange: How do you request a "pop up" IFR clearance?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1361/how-do-you-request-a-pop-up-ifr-clearance)
* *How to obtain an abbreviated IFR flight plan?* (See definition in pilot controller glossary)

# Ability to comply with the clearance

* Make sure to copy the clearance correctly
  * The readback should ensure this is the case
* Make sure to have information needed to adhere to the clearance
  * Taxi diagram
  * Departure procedure
* Set up FMS according to the clearance

# Correct and timely read-back of an ATC clearance, using standard phraseology

* See above

# Correct interpretation of an ATC clearance and, when necessary, request for clarification, verification, or change

* See above

# Setting of communication and navigation frequencies in compliance with an ATC clearance

* Departure frequency given with CRAFT clearance
* Check frequencies before takeoff
* "No dead frequencies"
* Suggest using COM1 for "air" frequencies and COM2 for "ground" frequencies
