# Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-directional Range (VOR)

* [AIM 1-1-3 VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_1.html#$paragraph1-1-3)
* VOR is a ground-based station which broadcasts signals that a plane can receive that indicates a *radial* that is the *magnetic bearing* to the station.
  * Inside the cockpit, the frequency of a VOR is input and the VOR indicator displays information about where the aircraft is relative to that VOR
  * The Omnibearing Selector (OBS) (sometimes referred to as the course selector) is a dial that can be rotated to select a desired radial
* Radials are projected outward *from* the station
  * However, any radial can be picked up regardless of where the aircraft is relative to the VOR
  * For example, if we are south of the Casanova VOR, we can pick up the 0&#176; radial that is projected northward from the station
* The information provided by a VOR alone is independent of the heading of the aircraft
* In addition to the *radial* information, we also get information as to whether the given radial will take us *to* or *from* the station
  * So in the example above about being south of Casanova VOR, if we dialed the 180&#176; radial we would see a `FROM` indication, but if we dialed in the 360&#176; radial we would see `TO`.
  * Remember this information is irrespective of the aircraft's heading
* VORW is a VOR *without voice*

* The VOR indicator also provides information with the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI)
  * This gives the pilot information as to how far off course they are when they have selected a radial by way of a needle that deflects left or right from center
  * ==Full-scale deflection on VOR is a deviation of 10 to 12 degrees.==
  * ==Each 1 nm from the VOR, two adjacent radials are 100 ft further apart==
  * ==So 60 nm from the VOR two adjacent radials would be 6000 ft apart or about 1 nm==
  * Or if 30 nm from station and 2 degree deflection on needle, are 6000 ft off course, or about 1 nm off course.
* Make sure the selected VOR is correct and functional before using
  * Check the morse code audio
  * Ensure the avionics displays the VOR identifier
* VOR is line-of-sight transmission
* **VOR Service Volumes**
  * Three classes of VOR / VORTAC that define service volume:
      1. T (Terminal)
      2. L (Low altitude)
      3. H (High altitude)

    > 1-1-8. NAVAID SERVICE VOLUMES  
    > a. Most air navigation radio aids which provide positive course guidance have a designated standard service volume (SSV).

  * To find the service volume class of a given VOR
    * Can find the service volume in the [Chart Supplement](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dafd/).
      * For example see `BOSTON (H) VOR/DME` indicating it is a high class `(H)`
    * See also: [Aviation StackExchange How do you know if a VOR is High, Low, or Terminal?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/26030/how-do-you-know-if-a-vor-is-high-low-or-terminal)
    * Can also check low and high altitude IFR charts to see which appear on each.
      * Here it is implicit, but Low Class `(L)` VORs will not appear on the IFR High Chart as their service volume tops out at 18,000 ft. AGL, and IFR charts are for use at or above 18,000 ft. MSL.
      * Note the difference between AGL and MSL. I don't know at what altitude the IFR high charts top out at, but there are Maximum Authorized Altitudes (MAA) so conceivably a Low Class `(L)` VOR located at 10,000 ft. MSL, for example, would provide 40 nm radius of service up to 28,000 ft. MSL and be used on a high chart.
      * In any case, following what is on the IFR charts for VOR navigation ensures a pilot need not worry too much about the various service volumes.

* **VOR Checks**
  * Recall from AVIATE acronym, VOR needs to be checked *every 30 days for IFR*
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.171(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRef6e8c57f580cfd/section-91.171)
  * For methods of checking the VOR
    * VOT: +/- 4 deg
    * Ground checkpoint: +/- 4 deg
    * Airborne checkpoint: +/- 6 deg
    * Dual check: within 4 deg
  * Can find VOT facilities in chart supplement
  * VOR accuracy requirements are given in [14 CFR &sect;91.171(b), (c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRef6e8c57f580cfd/section-91.171)

## Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)

* VOR is present in three different navigational aids
  * **VOR**
    * This is the fundamental capability described above
  * **VOR/DME**
    * When distance measuring equipment (DME) is installed with the VOR, tuning the VOR VHF frequency automatically selects the corresponding UHF DME frequency
    * DME is affected by slant-range errors, worse when closer to station and higher altitudes
    * [AIM 1-1-7 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_1.html#$paragraph1-1-7)
  * **VORTAC**
    * Combination of VOR and TACAN, where TACAN is military equipment, but provides DME to civilian users
    * Provides three pieces of information
      * VHF azimuth information
      * UHF TACAN azimuth information (like azimuth provided by VOR but for military only)
      * UHF TACAN distance information (can be used by non-military)
    * If VORTAC undergoing maintenance will not hear the morse code identifier
    * DME and VOR morse codes are transmitted seperately (even though they are the same identifier)
      * DME identifier is transmitted once for each 3-4 times the VOR identifier is transmitted
      * So depending on what is heard when listening for the identifier you can tell whether the DME is out or the VOR or both
    * DME is affected by slant-range errors, worse when closer to station
    * TACAN technology is very different from civilian DME, but the pilot's interaction with each is the same
    * [AIM 1-1-5 Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_1.html#$paragraph1-1-5)
    * [AIM 1-1-6 VHF Omni-directional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_1.html#$paragraph1-1-6)
* VHF radio band is 30 to 300 MHz

### VOT Check

* A VOT is a facility located at certain airports that emits a signal that can be used to test a plane's VOR receiver
* The VOT signals are generally designed to be used while on the ground, but some are designated as usable in air, with certain restrictions
* This information can be found in the chart supplement
