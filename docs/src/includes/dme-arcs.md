# DME Arcs

## Introduction

* A series of straight lines to approximate a circle
* Begin turn to join 0.7 nm prior to desired DME distance
* Turn 110&#176; if approaching from inside the arc and 70&#176; if approaching from outside the arc
* When DME hits proper arc distance turn 20&#176; toward VOR
  * Repeat until crossing the lead radial
  * If no lead radial, begin turn to exit arc 5&#176; prior to desired radial

### On 20&#176; Turns

* Real DME arcs "in the wild" exist with radii between 7 and 30 nm, inclusive
* Regardless of the specifics of the procedure, flying a DME arc involves a series of turns to fixed headings, "cutting the corners" of the arc
* Answering the question of how large each heading change should be is a balance between how accurately we wish to fly the arc, and the level of workload required while flying the arc
* More frequent turns mean a bit more work but a more accurate arc
* The ACS standards require DME arcs be flown +/- 1 nm
* Using 20&#176; turns throughout a DME arc will nominally allow this procedure to be applied on arcs up to 16.6 nm before reaching the 1 nm deviation
* To give a more of a buffer, a good rule-of-thumb is using 20&#176; when flying DME arcs up to 10 nm in radius
  * While arcs closer to the 7 nm lower limit are tougher to find on real approaches, it is often convenient in training to fly smaller arcs
  * Below gives a list of a few approaches which use DME arcs and the radius of the arc
