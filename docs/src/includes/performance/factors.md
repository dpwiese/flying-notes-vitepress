# Factors Affecting Performance

## Atmospheric Conditions

* High density altitude affects T/O, landing, climb rate
* Wind

## Pilot Technique

* Achieving the performance calculated during preflight planning is dependent on the pilot flying the aircraft as directed

## Airplane Configuration

* Achieving the performance calculated during preflight planning is dependent on the pilot configuring the aircraft as directed

## Airport Environment

* Runway surface
  * e.g. paved, grass
* Runway slope

## Loading and Weight and Balance

![Effects of CG movement.](/img/effects_of_cg_movement.jpg){width=340}

* CG too far forward
  * Longer takeoff distance
  * Higher stalling speed
  * Reduced elevator effectiveness
  * Increased stability
  * Reduced fuel economy and speed
  * Limit imposed by making sure enough elevator authority to hold the aircraft in normal glide with power off / aircraft's landing characteristics are suitable.
* CG too far rearward
  * Worse than too far forward
  * Unstable
  * Reduced elevator effectiveness
    * May not be able to recover from a spin
  * Limit imposed by stability (making sure aircraft has correct damping) / stall recovery
