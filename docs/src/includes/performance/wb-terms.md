# Weight and Balance Terms

* Including
  * Basic empty weight
  * Maximum gross weight
  * Arm
  * Moment
  * Reference datum
  * Center of gravity (CG) and CG limits
  * Useful load

### Definitions

* **Standard empty weight**
  * Plane and all permanently installed operating equipment
  * Also includes hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, full engine oil
* **Basic empty weight**
  * Standard empty weight plus optional and special equipment that have been installed
* **Ramp weight**
  * Plane loaded for flight prior to engine start (also known as taxi weight)
* **Takeoff weight**
  * Ramp weight minus fuel burned during taxi and run-up
* **Landing weight**
  * Greatest weight that an aircraft is normally allowed to have at landing

### Standard Weights

### Determination of Weight and Balance

* See Section 6 of aircraft POH for weight and balance information
* Need to use *actual* weight and balance info kept in the airplane
  * The W in S.P.A.R.(R).O.W is for weight and balance
* Weight and balance calculations are along the longitudinal direction
  * Weight won't vary too much along lateral axis, but can depending on passenger configuration and assymetric fuel burn
* See below for weight and balance for N3622A
