# Use of Charts, Tables, and Data to Determine Performance

* See Section 5 of aircraft POH for performance information
* Key phases of flight, performance charts to consult, and how they impact decision making
  * Takeoff and climbout
    * Is there enough runway to safely takeoff?
    * Is climb performance sufficient to clear surrounding terrain?
  * Cruise and fuel burn
    * Ensure enough fuel is available to complete flight
    * Determine duration of flight to know which weather forecasts to reference
  * Landing
    * Is there enough runway to safely land?
