# Multi-engine Performance

* Accelerate-stop / accelerate-go distances
  * What will happen if an engine failure is encountered at various points during takeoff and climbout?
* See Baron-specific section below for performance charts
* **All engine service ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will climb at a rate of 100 FPM in smooth air with AEI
* **All engine absolute ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will no longer climb at all with AEI
* **Single engine service ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will climb at a rate of 50 FPM in smooth air with OEI
* **Single engine absolute ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will no longer climb at all with OEI
* **Accelerate-stop distance**
  * Achieve maximum power prior to break release
  * Reach lift-off speed
  * Both throttles to idle
  * Come to a complete stop
  * [14 CFR &sect; 23.55 (2017)](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2017-08-29/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-23/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR5ed09dfc2a6b782/section-23.55) for aircraft more than 6,000 lb
* **Accelerate-go distance**
  * Achieve maximum power prior to break release
  * Reach lift-off speed
  * One engine dies
  * Climb to a height of 50 feet
* Performance data in POH based on a new aircraft
* Performance data in POH is based on trained professional test pilot
* No requirements on runway length that are dependant on accelerate-stop or accelerate-go distances
* Use good ADM to determine personal minimums associated with runway use
