# Effects of Exceeding Aircraft Limitations

Understand how to determine aircraft weight and balance and performance limitations, and the importance of operating the aircraft within its limitations to remain safe and avoid damage to the aircraft.

* See Section 2 of aircraft POH for Limitations
* Placards (also in POH)
* Purpose: Mitigate risk of damage
* Generally CG affects stability and control
* Limitations include
  * Weight and balance
  * Airspeed
  * Powerplant
  * Maneuver
    * For example, spins may be approved
    * Also depends on loading and thus category (utility or normal)
  * Flight into known icing
  * Fuel
    * How much fuel can be carried
  * Oil
    * Type of oil
  * Flap
    * Airspeeds flaps can be used
  * Gear
    * Airspeeds when retractable gear can be used
  * Instrument
    * Excessive pitch attitutde can tumble attitude indicator

Aircraft are certificated for weight and balance for two principal reasons:

1. The effect of the weight on the aircraft's primary structure and its performance characteristics
2. The effect of the location of this weight on flight characteristics, particularly in stall and spin recovery and stability
