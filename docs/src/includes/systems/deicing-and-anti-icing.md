# Deicing and Anti-icing

## Airframe

* Wings
  * Boots
    * Use as soon as icing is observed
  * Heated leading edge
    * Also called "hot wing"
    * Uses hot air from turbine compressor, for example
  * Weeping wing
    * Deicing fluid (e.g. TKS fluid, like antifreeze) comes out of small holes in leading edge
    * TKS (Tecalemit-Kilfrost-Sheepbridge Stokes) was the name of a British aerospace company during WWII that developed the original weeping wing technology
* Windscreen
  * Alcohol
  * Hot air defrost
  * Electric (like rear window of car)
  * Icing fluid from prop in single engine also sprays back on windscreen

## Propellor or Rotor

* Propellor
  * Alcohol
  * Electric heating element
  * Boots

## Air Intake

* Carb heat
* Spring-loaded air-filter bypass door
* Alternate air

## Fuel System

* Check for water in fuel during preflight

## Pitot-Static System

* Pitot heat
* Alternate static source

## Encountering Icing

* ==Exit area of icing==
* ==Generally climb==
  * ==To find temps colder than -20 &#176;C==
  * ==Being higher gives more options==
  * Alternatively descend to find temperatures warmer than 5 &#176;C
* ==Gentle maneuvers==
  * Avoid increasing load factor too much
* ==Fly faster==
* ==Avoid configuration change==
  * No flaps to avoid tailplane stall
