# Primary flight controls

::: warning Primary Flight Controls
Control the surfaces to create the moments to rotate an aircraft about its three axes of rotation.
:::

* Airplanes are maneuvered by *changing the direction of lift*.
* There are three axes about which moments are applied and the aircraft rotates.
  * Different primary flight control surfaces
    * Elevator
    * Aileron
    * Rudder
    * More
      * V-tail
      * Stabilator
* Control surfaces intended to induce moments about one particular axis often also induce moments about other axes as well
  * Differential ailerons
  * Adverse yaw
  * Rudder induces rolling moment
