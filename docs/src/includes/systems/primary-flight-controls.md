# Primary flight controls

::: warning Primary Flight Controls
Control the surfaces to create the moments to rotate an aircraft about its three axes of rotation.
:::

* Airplanes are maneuvered by *changing the direction of lift*.
* There are three axes about which moments are applied and the aircraft rotates.
  * Different primary flight control surfaces
    * Elevator
    * Aileron
    * Rudder
    * More
      * V-tail
      * Stabilator

## Adverse Moments

* Control surfaces intended to induce moments about one particular axis often also induce moments about other axes as well
* For example, with the vertical stabilizer being offset above the aircraft's longitudinal access, deflection of the rudder, while it primarily induces a yawing moment also induces a rolling moment
* **Adverse yaw** is the term used to describe the yawing moment that typically accompanies deflection of the ailerons
  * For exampe, to roll to the right the left aileron must deflect downwards
  * This downward deflection, used to increase the left on the left wing, also creates additional drag and therefor a yawing moment to the right, opposite the direction of turn
  * This is why coordination of ailerons and rudders is important
* **Differential ailerons** are a design choice used to reduce this effect by reducing the downward aileron deflection relative to the upward deflection.
  * The Piper Archer uses differential ailerons
