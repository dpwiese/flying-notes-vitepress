# Powerplant

* Reciprocating engines
  * Theory of operation
    * Cylinder count, displacement, and horsepower
    * How a 4-stroke cylinder works
    * Basics of 2-stroke
    * SAFETY: Why we need to learn this?
  * Types
    * Radial
      * Generally good power-to-weight but large frontal area
    * Inline
      * Small frontal area, poor cooling at rear cylinders
    * V-type
    * Horizontally opposed
      * Good power-to-weight, and reasonably small frontal area
  * General consideration of reciprocating engines
    * Power-to-weight ratio
    * Cooling (for example in horizontally opposed engine rear cylinders get less air)
    * Frontal area (drag)
  * Supercharging and Turbocharging
    * Wastegate
    * Critical Altitude
    * SAFETY: Overboost condition
* Fuel-air ratios are by weight

## Cooling system

* Air cooled via inlet
* Considerations during ground operations and flight
  * Cylinders have fins to increase surface area and dissipate heat
  * Position into wind during runup
  * High power and low speed configurations
    * Cruise climb for cooling
  * Shock cooling
  * Cowl Flaps
* Use oil temperature gauge and cylinder head temperature (CHT) gauge
  * If temp is high increase airspeed, enrich the mixture, and/or reduce power
* Operating the engine at higher than its designed temperature can cause the following, as well as permanent engine damage
  * Loss of power
  * Excessive oil consumption
  * Detonation
* Operating the engine at low temps is also bad

## Exhaust system

* Discharges combustion byproducts into free stream
* Shroud around muffler captures waste heat for heating cabin and using for defrost
* EGT and leaning procedures
* SAFETY: Heating & CO poisoning (symptoms, remedies)
