# Propeller

* Is a rotating airfoil
  * Subject to all characteristics of airfoil as wing (induced drag, stalling)
* Constant-speed propeller vs fixed pitch
  * Governor
  * Efficiency
* **Geometric pitch**
  * Distance a propeller theoretically would advance in one rotation based only on the incidence angle of the propeller blades
* **Effective pitch**
  * Distance a propeller actually advances in one revolution
* **Propeller slip**
  * Difference between geometric pitch and effective pitch
* Fixed pitch
* Variable pitch
  * Pitch of the propeller can be changed
    * For example, the Beechcraft 215 had an electrical adjustment mechanism
  * Ground adjustable
    * Adjusted to desired position on the ground using tools
  * Constant speed
    * A type of variable pitch controlled by a governor so the pitch is automatically adjusted to maintain a specific RPM

## Multi-engine Airplane Propeller

* In most single-engine planes the "default" prop position is full-forward
* ==In most multi-engine planes the "default" prop position is feathered==
* ==This provides better single engine performance in the event of an engine failure==
* ==Oil pressure is required to unfeather the prop==
* ==This "default" feathered position is provided by counterweights as well as springs or nitrogen, which aids to force oil out of the prop hub and allow the prop to feather==
  * Springs or nitrogen are there to help when RPMs are lower and the counterweights are less effective
* Aerodynamic forces tend to drive the propeller to the low pitch, high RPM position
* Below approximately 800 RPM, a reduction in centrifugal force allows small anti-feathering lock pins in the pitch changing mechanism of the propeller hub to move into place and block feathering so the prop doesn't feather on every engine shutdown.
* Therefore, if a propeller is to be feathered, it needs to be done before engine speed decays below approximately 800 RPM.
* **Propeller synchronizer** - device which can be engage after the props are set to approximately the same RPM to automatically synchronize them
* **Propeller syncrophaser** - like a synchronizer, but compares and adjusts the positions of *each of the individual blades of the propellers in their arcs* to significantly reduce propeller noise and vibration
