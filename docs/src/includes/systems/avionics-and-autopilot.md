# Avionics and Autopilot

* **Avionics** - electronic systems used on aircraft
* Communication
  * VHF
* Navigation
  * VOR (VHF)
  * TACAN (UHF for DME for GA)
  * GPS
* Display
* Autopilot
  * Bendix/King KAP 140 is 2-axis autopilot (pitch, roll)
  * Reduce pilot workload
  * Needs to be monitored to ensure correct operation
* Some avionics (G5) have battery backup to continue functioning even if plane's battery dies

## Instructor Note

* Probably the most important thing here, especially given the diversity of avionics across many flight school's planes, is operational profficiency with the particular avionics in the plane you are flying
* Need to know how to at least perform the basics proficiently so as not to increase pilot workload during flight
  * Use of radios and navigational aids
  * Enter in flight plan / waypoint / destination
  * Situational awareness
