# Ignition System

* Two magnetos and spark plugs for redundancy
  * Also provides more power via more complete combustion
  * Doesn't require battery power to work
  * No drop of RPM during single magneto runup check indicates broken magneto wires
* Magneto check R magneto first so that after checking L it's one click back to BOTH
* Spark plug fouling results from running too rich mixture
* **Detonation**
  * ==Instantaneous combustion==
  * Occurs at high power settings when too lean
  * Often occurs when using lower grade of fuel
* **Preignition**
  * ==When hot spots in cylinder ignites air/fuel mixture prematurely==
* ==Detonation and preignition often occur simultaneously and one may cause the other.==
  * Since either condition causes high engine temperature accompanied by a decrease in engine performance, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two.
* To avoid detonation
  * Ensure that the proper grade of fuel is used.
  * Keep the cowl flaps open while on the ground
  * Enriched the mixture, as well as a shallow climb angle, to increase cylinder cooling during takeoff and initial climb
  * Avoid extended, high power, steep climbs.
  * Monitor the engine instruments in flight to verify proper operation
* SAFETY: P-lead & ground check after landing
  * P-lead is the primary lead of the magneto
  * Grounding the P-lead disables the magneto
  * If magnetos aren't grounded, they stay on or "hot" even when the key is out

## Impulse Coupling

* In most general aviation aircraft, ignition timing is fixed to provide maximum power at redline
* This is somewhere around 20 degrees before top dead center (BTDC)
* In order to change the ignition timing to enable starting an impulse coupling is used
* The impulse coupling mounts between the engine and magnetos and contains some springloaded flyweights and an internal spring
* At low RPM it engages, delays rotation of the magnetos and winds up the spring, releasing somewhere past TDC to initiate the spark

::: danger SAFETY
When turning the prop by hand, always rotate it opposite the direction it normally spins to prevent engaging the impulse coupling and potentially trigger ignition of the magneto p-lead is damaged.
