## Magnetos

* In most general aviation aircraft, ignition timing is fixed to provide maximum power at readline
* This is somewhere around 20 degrees before top dead center (BTDC)
* In order to change the ignition timing to enable starting an impulse coupling is used
* The impulse coupling mounts between the engine and magnetos and contains some springloaded flyweights and an internal spring
* At low RPM it engages, delays rotation of the magnetos and winds up the spring, releasing somewhere past TDC to initiate the spark

::: danger SAFETY
When turning the prop by hand, always rotate it opposite the direction it normally spins to prevent engaging the impulse coupling and potentially trigger ignition of the magneto p-lead is damaged.

# Propeller

* Is a rotating airfoil
  * Subject to all characteristics of airfoil as wing (induced drag, stalling)
* Constant-speed propeller vs fixed pitch
  * Governor
  * Efficiency
* **Effective pitch**
  * Distance a propellor advances in one revolution
* **Propellor slip**
  * Difference between geometric pitch and effective pitch

![Propellor. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 7: Aircraft Systems](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/09_phak_ch7.pdf) Figure 7-6.](/img/phak/phak-figure-7-6-propellor.png){width=400}

# Multi-engine Airplane Propeller

* In most single-engine planes the "default" prop position is full-forward
* ==In most multi-engine planes the "default" prop position is feathered==
* ==This provides better single engine performance in the event of an engine failure==
* ==Oil pressure is required to unfeather the prop==
* ==This "default" feathered position is provided by counterweights as well as springs or nitrogen, which aids to force oil out of the prop hub and allow the prop to feather==
  * Springs or nitrogen are there to help when RPMs are lower and the counterweights are less effective
* Aerodynamic forces tend to drive the propellor to the low pitch, high RPM position
* Below approximately 800 RPM, a reduction in centrifugal force allows small anti-feathering lock pins in the pitch changing mechanism of the propeller hub to move into place and block feathering so the prop doesn't feather on every engine shutdown.
* Therefore, if a propeller is to be feathered, it needs to be done before engine speed decays below approximately 800 RPM.
* **Propeller synchronizer** - device which can be engage after the props are set to approximately the same RPM to automatically synchronize them
* **Propeller syncrophaser** - like a synchronizer, but compares and adjusts the positions of *each of the individual blades of the propellers in their arcs* to significantly reduce propeller noise and vibration

# Induction Systems

* Two types
  * Carbureted
  * Fuel injected
* Alternate engine air intake system
* Airflow & Alternate Air
  * Can be manual or automatic
  * In fuel injected planes, alternate air can be automatic via spring-loaded bypass
* Manifold pressure
* As altitude increases, performance reduction
* SAFETY: Blockage indications
* For carburetors and carb heat see fuel system section below
* **Impact icing**
  * Can affect fuel-injected aircraft by icing over the air filter

# Ignition system

* Two magnetos and spark plugs for redundancy
  * Also provides more power via more complete combustion
  * Doesn't require battery power to work
  * No drop of RPM during single magneto runup check indicates broken magneto wires
* Magneto check R magneto first so that after checking L it's one click back to BOTH
* Spark plug fouling results from running too rich mixture
* **Detonation**
  * ==Instantaneous combustion==
  * Occurs at high power settings when too lean
  * Often occurs when using lower grade of fuel
* **Preignition**
  * ==When hot spots in cylinder ignites air/fuel mixture prematurely==
* ==Detonation and preignition often occur simultaneously and one may cause the other.==
  * Since either condition causes high engine temperature accompanied by a decrease in engine performance, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two.
* To avoid detonation
  * Ensure that the proper grade of fuel is used.
  * Keep the cowl flaps open while on the ground
  * Enriched the mixture, as well as a shallow climb angle, to increase cylinder cooling during takeoff and initial climb
  * Avoid extended, high power, steep climbs.
  * Monitor the engine instruments in flight to verify proper operation
* SAFETY: P-lead & ground check after landing
  * P-lead is the primary lead of the magneto
  * Grounding the P-lead disables the magneto
  * If magnetos aren't grounded, they stay on or "hot" even when the key is out

# Cooling system

* Air cooled via inlet
* Considerations during ground operations and flight
  * Cylinders have fins to increase surface area and dissipate heat
  * Position into wind during runup
  * High power and low speed configurations
    * Cruise climb for cooling
  * Shock cooling
  * Cowl Flaps
* Use oil temperature gauge and cylinder head temperature (CHT) gauge
  * If temp is high increase airspeed, enrich the mixture, and/or reduce power
* Operating the engine at higher than its designed temperature can cause the following, as well as permanent engine damage
  * Loss of power
  * Excessive oil consumption
  * Detonation
* Operating the engine at low temps is also bad

# Exhaust system

* Discharges combustion byproducts into free stream
* Shroud around muffler captures waste heat for heating cabin and using for defrost
* EGT and leaning procedures
* SAFETY: Heating & CO poisoning (symptoms, remedies)
