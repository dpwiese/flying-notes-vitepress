# Landing Gear

* Wheels, floats, skis
* Fixed / Retractable
  * Retractable gear might be actuated by an electric motor powering a hydraulic pump, or purely electric
* Tricycle / tailwheel
  * Tricycle advantages
    * Better braking
    * Better forward visibility during taxi, takeoff, landing
    * Better stability during ground operations (CG in front of main wheels)
* Struts
  * Air/oil, spring steel
* Brakes
