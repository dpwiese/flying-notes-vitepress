# Oxygen system

* In a mixture of gases, each constituent gas has a **partial pressure** which is the notional pressure of that constituent gas as if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature.
* Components
  * Mask/cannula
  * Supply (bottle/air bleed)
  * Regulator
* *For optimum protection, pilots are encouraged to use supplemental oxygen above 10,000 feet cabin altitude during the day and above 5,000 feet at night.*
* Most regulators provide 100% cabin air at around 8,000 ft, and 100% oxygen at 34,000 ft, with the ratio changing in between.
* Be aware of the danger of fire when using oxygen
* Masks
  * Face worn mask or cannula
  * Most masks are the oronasal type that covers only the mouth and nose
  * Cannula only goes in nose. More comfortable, but is not as reliable at providing adequate oxygen.
  * Current regulations require aircraft with oxygen systems installed and certified for operations above 18,000 feet to be equipped with oxygen masks instead of cannulas.
* Oxygen delivery systems
  * **Diluter-Demand**
    * Supply oxygen only when the user inhales through the mask
    * Used up to 40,000 ft
  * **Pressure-Demand**
    * Supply oxygen to mask at positive pressure above 34,000 ft
    * Used above 40,000 ft
  * **Continuous-Flow**
    * Most common kind in general aviation aircraft
    * Usually provided for passengers
  * **Electrical Pulse-Demand**
    * provide oxygen flow during the initial portion of inhalation
    * do not waste oxygen during the breathing cycle
    * reduce oxygen 50-85 percent compared to continuous-flow
