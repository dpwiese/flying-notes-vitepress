# Induction System

* Two types
  * Carbureted
  * Fuel injected
* Alternate engine air intake system
* Airflow & Alternate Air
  * Can be manual or automatic
  * In fuel injected planes, alternate air can be automatic via spring-loaded bypass
* Manifold pressure
* As altitude increases, performance reduction
* SAFETY: Blockage indications
* For carburetors and carb heat see fuel system section below
* **Impact icing**
  * Can affect fuel-injected aircraft by icing over the air filter
* Turbo
  * Compressor is driven by a turbine that itself is driven by exhaust gasses
  * Turbonormalizer is used to increased the intake air pressure to sea level or slightly above
  * Turbocharger can pressurize the intake air substantially above sea level pressure
