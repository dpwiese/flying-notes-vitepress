# Medical Deficiencies

* [14 CFR &sect;61.53 Prohibition on operations during medical deficiency](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.53)
  * If you have a medical certificate and are taking medication or have a condition which would make you no longer meet the requirements *then you cannot fly*
  * Don't fly if you are unable to operate the aircraft in a safe manner
* Certain medical conditions are disqualifying
  * [FAA What medical conditions does the FAA consider disqualifying?](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/medical_certification/faq/response6)
* Certain medical conditions will result in being issued a medical certificate with a limitation on it
  * For example if an applicant fails to meet the color vision standard as interpreted above but is otherwise qualified, the Examiner must issue a medical certificate bearing the limitation
    * Not valid for night flying or by color signal control
  * [Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners Application Process for Medical Certification](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/general/si/)
  * [Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners Aerospace Medical Dispositions Item 52. Color Vision](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item52/amd/)
  * Another example of a limitation is for someone who is hearing impaired they would require the limitation "not valid for flight requiring the use of radio."
  * Some disabilities may require special equipment to be installed in the aircraft, such as hand controls for pilots with paraplegia.
* **Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA)**
  * A statement authorizing medical certification of, at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, applicants whose disqualifying condition is static or non-progressive.
  * May be issued Letter of Evidence (LOE) that needs to be carried along with medical
  * May involve different levels of tests (e.g. Operational Color Vision Test (OCVT), Medical Flight Test (MFT))
* If you have any concern about potential medical deficiency, good idea to get medical certificate in the early stages of flight training
  * Remember, medical (and student pilot) certificate is required to solo
  * No age limit to log dual received, so potentially could be paying for and receiving a lot of flight training before even being eligible to solo, only to later find out you can't get medical (or it has limitation)
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(h) - Logging training time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(h))
