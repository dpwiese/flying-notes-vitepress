# Additional Night Lighting Requirements

* Regarding lights see also [14 CFR &sect;91.209 Aircraft lights](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.209)
* No person may, from sunset to sunrise, park or move an aircraft in, or in dangerous proximity to, a night flight operations area of an airport unless the aircraft:
  * Is clearly illuminated
  * Has lighted position lights
  * Or is in an area that is marked by obstruction lights
* Basically when pushing the plane around at night with the towbar, for example, unless the area is well lit, leave the nav lights on.
  * See: [Aviation StackExchange If I am pushing my aircraft into the hangar with a tow bar, at night, with the engine off, am I required to activate my rotating beacon?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/37097/if-i-am-pushing-my-aircraft-into-the-hangar-with-a-tow-bar-at-night-with-the-e/37307#37307)
  * *Note: this is a good example where there are grey areas in the definitions, for example how clear is "clearly illuminated" so the obvious thing to do if in doubt at all is just leave the nav lights on.*

    > What is a night flight operations area? Absent any proffered definition, the plain reading of the phrase-as I read it-would be an area used, or subject to use, for flight operations at night. In other words, any public use airport with an apron or taxiway that is open to flight operations at night could and should be considered-by my reading-a night flight operations area. Whether the area is a movement or non-movement area shouldn't matter. Could someone else reasonably taxi past you (or into you!) at night? That's probably a night flight operations area.
