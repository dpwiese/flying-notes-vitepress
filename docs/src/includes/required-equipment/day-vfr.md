## Note on Fuel Gauges

* This note exists to provide some context around statements regarding the required accuracy of fuel gauges.
* The below provides some excerpts of the regulations around fuel gauges depending on which set of regulations a given aircraft are certified under.
* [14 CFR &sect;23.2430(a)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-23/section-23.2430#p-23.2430(a)(4))
  * This is the most recent CFR for normal category airplanes that gives fuel gauge requirements.

    > Each fuel system mustâ€” Provide the flightcrew with a means to determine the total useable fuel available and provide uninterrupted supply of that fuel when the system is correctly operated, accounting for likely fuel fluctuations;

* [14 CFR &sect;23.1337(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2017-01-03/title-14/part-23/section-23.1337#p-23.1337(b))
  * The relevant CFR prior to the Part 23 rewrite that went into effect on August 30, 2017.

    > **Fuel quantity indication.** There must be a means to indicate to the flightcrew members the quantity of usable fuel in each tank during flight. An indicator calibrated in appropriate units and clearly marked to indicate those units must be used.
