* To act as PIC
  * Flight review within previous 24 calendar months
    * 1 hour flight and 1 hour ground training

* The update that brought the change from passengers to persons also brought a change to the definition of [passenger](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.1#p-61.1(b)(Passenger)) to clarify that persons providing or receiving flight training are not passengers.
