# Land and hold short operations (LAHSO)

::: warning Land and hold short operations (LAHSO)
These operations include landing and holding short of an intersecting runway, an intersecting taxiway, or some other designated point on a runway other than an intersecting runway or taxiway.

* See [AIM 4-3-11 Pilot Responsibilities When Conducting Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap4_section_3.html#$paragraph4-3-11)
* Also [FAA Safety - LAHSO - Land and Hold Short Operations](https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/25/181/LAHSO.pdf)
* Available Landing Distance (ALD), hold short point, and more information can be found in the [Digital Terminal Procedures Publication (d-TPP)/Airport Diagrams](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dtpp/).
* The states covered by each region are shown below.
  * For example, the Washington DC area is in [NE3](https://aeronav.faa.gov/upload_313-d/terminal/2022-07-14/NE3.pdf), and New York / New Jersey is [NE2](https://aeronav.faa.gov/upload_313-d/terminal/2022-07-14/NE2.pdf)
* ATC may *offer* a LAHSO clearance to the pilot of an arriving aircraft
  * e.g. "Cessna N12345 cleared to land runway 12, hold short of runway 34, 5600 feet available."
  * ==As PIC you are not obliged to accept the LAHSO clearance==
  * Pilot can request Available Landing Distance (ALD)
  * If there are any doubts, exercise good ADM and do not accept LAHSO clearance
  * If clearance is accepted, need to adhere, or receive a new clearance
  * In the event of a rejected landing, notify ATC as soon as possible
* Do the following to ensure that LAHSO operations are conducted properly
  * Know landing distance available
  * Be advised by ATC as to why LAHSO are being conducted
  * Advise ATC if you cannot comply with LAHSO
    * "unable"
  * Know what signs and markings are at the LAHSO point
  * LAHSO are not authorized for student pilots who are performing a solo flight
  * At many airports air carrier aircraft are not authorized to participate in LAHSO if the other aircraft is a general aviation aircraft
  * Generally, LAHSO are not authorized at night
  * LAHSO are not authorized on wet runways or with tailwind
    * However, turbulence might be a weather factor leading to a higher approach speed than planned, or the *lack* of a headwind
* From AIM above: ==*A LAHSO clearance does not preclude a rejected landing.*==
  * If you have to go around after accepting LAHSO clearance, maintain separation from vehicles and aircraft and promptly notify tower.
* Student pilots
  * AIM says student pilots should not participate in the LAHSO program
  * [Order JO 7110.118B Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/2020-07-30_JO_7110.118B_-_Land_and_Hold_Short_Operations_%28LAHSO%29_FINAL.pdf) to ATC says when student pilots identify themselves as such, they must not be issued a LAHSO clearance
  * Interestingly the previous version [7110.118 Land and Hold Short Operations](https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/order/7110.118.pdf) says "solo student pilots will not conduct LAHSO" and student pilots of course cannot carry passengers.
  * But the above I think *technically* doesn't preclude student pilot from accepting LAHSO, but the practical answer is that they should *never* accept.
* May encounter runway hold markings on a runway even when not conducting LAHSO operations, as sometimes will be given clearance to taxi on a runway (and hold short of intersecting runway)
