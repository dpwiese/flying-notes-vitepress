# Flight Deck Check

* During preflight check all antennas and pitot tube and static ports for blockage
* Check aircraft records
  * 24-month pitot-static inspection
  * 30-day VOR inspection
* Check NOTAMs for conditions of NAVAIDs to be used in flight
* When turning on the Master switch during preflight, listen to electric gyros as they spin up
* Check pitot heat
* Check lights

## Communications Equipment

* ==Check integrity of antennas during preflight==
  * Antennas can become damaged due to ice
* Can hear clearly over COM1 and COM2
* Observe TX when depressing PTT

## Navigation Equipment

* Two primary systems to check
  * GPS
  * VOR
* Check system status indication as applicable
* No annunciators
* GPS correctly shows location
  * Check databases
    * See table in [AIM Table 1-1-6](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_1.html#ffAks301atcn)
    * ==Databases need not be current, but during enroute you must check each point in the aircraft GPS against a source that is current, e.g. Foreflight and make sure none of the points have changed==
    * ==Same with using GPS for approach - need to make sure approach hasn't changed or been amended since your database date, even if your database is out-of-date==
    * =="Verification of correctness"==
  * Check RAIM
    * Will we have adequate satellite coverage
* Review VOR test sheet is within 30 days and in spec
  * Date
  * Place
  * Bearing error
  * Signature

## Magnetic Compass

* Compass should
  * Float freely and turn freely in turns
  * Indicate correctly on known headings (e.g. when aligned with runway)

## Heading indicator/horizontal situation indicator/remote magnetic indicator

* Also known as **directional gyro**
* Usually powered by the aircraft vacuum system
* Errors in compass make it hard to use to turn to specific headings, especially in turbulent air - heading indicator helps with this
* Some heading indicators referred to as **horizontal situation indicators** (HSI) receive a magnetic north reference from a magnetic slaving transmitter and generally need no adjustment.
  * See also: remote indicating compass
* **Radio magnetic indicator** (RMI)
* Should indicate correctly and turn freely

## Attitude indicator

* Required for IFR flight
* Generally vacuum powered or solid-state (e.g. Garmin G5)
* During taxi check
  * Erect
  * ==Less than 5 degree lean==

## Altimeter

* Reads within 75 feet of field elevation when set to local altimeter setting

## Turn-and-slip indicator/turn coordinator

* **Turn coordinator:**
  * Roll rate (initially)
  * Rate of turn (after it stabilizes)
  * Quality of turn
  * Contains **inclinometer**
    * The ball
    * "step on the ball" to coordinate flight
* **Turn and slip indicator:**
  * Rate of turn
  * Quality of turn
* Turing taxi should indicate direction of turn and ball should go to outside of turn

## Vertical-speed indicator

* Not required equipment for VFR or IFR flight
* Uses static pressure only
* Should indicate 0 when on the ground
* ==If it indicates something other than 0, this value can be used as 0 and then interpret changes from that value==
* Should see a small momentary deviation from 0 when changing to alternate static source

## Airspeed indicator

* Requires pitot and static pressure
* Required for day VFR operation
* Should read 0 when stationary and while taxiing

## Outside air temperature

* Should read ambient air temperature

## Clock

* Check correct time and running

## Pilot heat

* In most aircraft, can pull a knob to turn on cabin heat
* Cabin heat captures waste heat from the exhaust by passing intake air through a shroud around the exhaust and then into the cabin
* Need to be especially mindful of CO poisoning when using cabin heat

## Electronic flight instrument display

* No annunciators
* No red X's

## Traffic awareness/warning/avoidance system

* ADS-B status in status page where applicable
* Follow POH/STC for status of other systems where applicable

## Terrain awareness/warning/alert system

* Synthetic vision provides a realistic depiction of the aircraft in relation to terrain and flightpath
* Terrain Awareness Warning System can be shown on MFD
* Two types
  * Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)
  * Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS)
* Terrain warning systems can use radar altimeter to get more accurate measurement of absolute altitude or GPS along with terrain database

## Flight management system (FMS)

* ==A Flight Management System (FMS) automates the tasks of managing the onboard navigation systems==
* A FMS is not a navigation system in itself
* Aggregates sources of position data to determine best actual position
* Simplifies entering of of waypoint information
  * ==Instead of latitude/longitude coordinates use a database of predefined waypoints==

## Automatic pilot

* Do preflight check of autopilot according to POH
* Know where the autopilot fuse is
