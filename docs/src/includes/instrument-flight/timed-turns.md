# Timed Turns

* "Times 3 minus 3"
  * Take the leading digit of the heading change, multiply it by 3 and sutract 3 to get the number of seconds to hold the 15&#176; bank turn
  * For example, to turn 30&#176; (3&times;3=9, 9&minus;3=6) roll into a 15&#176; degree turn and hold for 6 seconds then roll out
