# Instrument Flight

* Two methods of performing attitude instrument flight
  * **Control and Performance Method**
    * Aircraft performance is accomplished by controlling the aircraft attitude and power output
    * Instruments broken up into control, performance, and navigation
    * ==Set the power and attitude, then monitor the performance and make adjustments==
  * **Primary and Supporting Method**
    * ==Focuses more on the instruments that depict the most accurate indication for the aspect of the aircraft attitude being controlled==
    * All changes to aircraft attitude need to be made using the attitude indicator and the power instruments
* **Primary and supporting instruments for straight-and-level flight**
  * **Primary**
    * Altitude
      * Altimeter
    * Heading
      * Heading indicator
    * Speed
      * Airspeed indicator
  * **Supporting**
    * Altitude
      * VSI
      * Attitude indicator
    * Heading
      * Turn coordinator
      * Attitude indicator
    * Airspeed
      * Tach / manifold pressure
* Primary vs secondary instruments
  * Example of primary instruments during straight-and-level flight:
    * Altimeter for altitude
    * Heading indicator for bank
    * Airspeed for power
  * Example when establishing a turn:
    * Attitude indicator is primary for bank
    * Turn coordinator is secondary for bank
* Power vs control instruments

## Climbs / Descents

* Enrich, pitch, power, trim
* Climb / descend then turn

## Partial Panel

* Use magnetic compass / turn coordinator / GPS for heading
* Use airspeed / VSI / altimeter for pitch
* Zoom in on MFD moving map and keep airplane on magenta line
