# Timed and Compass Turns

## Purpose

* The backup source of heading information in many aircraft is a magnetic compass.
* Attempting to use the compass like a heading indicator (rolling out upon reaching the desired heading as indicated by the compass) can result in large heading errors upon completion of the roll out.
  * This is due to errors associated with the compass.
* Therefore alternative techniques to be able to use the compass to accurately are required

## Elements

:::warning Timed and compass turns
Timed and compass turns are two different techniques that exist to enable accurate heading changes be made when the only source of heading information is a magnetic compass.
:::

* A magnetic compass provides an accurate heading reference during straight and level flight but it does not accurately indicate the aircraft's heading during turns
* Timed turns used for turns of less than 60&#176;
* Compass turns used for turns of more than 60&#176;
