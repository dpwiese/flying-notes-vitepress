# Alternates Under IFR

* Start with the big picture
  * Weather depiction chart
  * Find the nearest good weather
  * Often behind the weather system
* Back up with a forecast
  * TAF within 5 nm
* ==If flying a non-WAAS-equipped plane, alternate must have an approach other than GPS==
  * If flying a WAAS-equipped plane, can use an alternate with only GPS approach
  * [Code 7700 Alternate IAP Requirements](https://code7700.com/alternate_iap_requirements.htm#gsc.tab=0)
* [14 CFR &sect;91.169(c) - IFR flight plan: Information required](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.169#p-91.169)
* **When is an alternate airport required to be filed on an IFR flight plan**
  * ==**1-2-3 rule - an alternate is not required if:**==
    * ==The desination airport has an IAP and==
      * ==From 1 hour before to 1 hour after arrival time weather is predicted to be better than==
      * ==2000 ft ceilings and==
      * ==3 sm visibility==
  * ==*If destination does not have an IAP, an alternate is required*==
    * Even if the destination weather forecast is completely clear
* ==When an alternate *is* required, then *at the estimated time of arrival at the alternate airport*, the ceiling and visibility at the alternate airport will be at or above the following weather minima, or it cannot be used as an alternate.==
  * ==Whatever is specified as the alternate minimums for that IAP==
  * ==If no alternate minimums are specificed:==
    * ==Precision approach: 600 ft ceilings, 2 sm visibility==
    * ==Non-precision approach: 800 ft ceilings, 2 sm visibility==
  * ==Or if there is no IAP, then weather good enough to allow descent from MEA, approach, and landing under VFR.==
* Also note that you can file IFR to an airport without an instrument approach, and in this case you must have an alternate no matter what.
* So basically what you do is:
    1. Determine if alternate is required
        * [14 CFR &sect;91.169(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.169#p-91.169(a)(2))
        * ==If destination airport doesn't have IAP - you need alternate==
        * ==If destination airport does have IAP - apply 1-2-3 rule==
          * If by the 1-2-3 rule an alternate is *not* required you are done
    2. If you need alternate, next have to determine if the desired alternate can be used
        * [14 CFR &sect;91.169(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.169#p-91.169(c))
        * ==If desired alternate does not have IAP, weather *at the ETA* must allow descent and landing under VFR to use as alternate==
        * ==If desired alternate does have IAP, review it (or multiple IAPs that the aircraft is capable of) and see if there are alternate minimums listed.==
        * ==Otherwise apply standard minimums to determine if the desired alternate can actually be used as your alternate based on weather *at the ETA*==
* *==Note: if during flight you arrive at intended destination and cannot land due to current weather, you need not go to the filed alternate. If the weather is different than what was forecast during flight planning and there is a better alternate, use that instead.==*
* ==***If flying a non-WAAS-equipped plane, alternate must have an approach other than GPS***==
  * If flying a WAAS-equipped plane, can use an alternate with only GPS approach
