  * **Circle**: Stay in one spot
  * **Climb**: Better visibility, better signal and communication strength
  * **Communicate**: Ask for vectors to a known location
  * **Confess**: Admit you are lost
  * **Calculate**: Figure out fuel remaining, where to go, groundspeed, distance covered
* Double check maps and look for landmarks
* Use secondary navigation systems (GPS, VOR)
  * Nearest or Direct-To
