# VOR Check

* Recall from AVIATE acronym, VOR needs to be checked *every 30 days for IFR*
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.171(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRef6e8c57f580cfd/section-91.171)
* VOR accuracy requirements [14 CFR &sect;91.171(b), (c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRef6e8c57f580cfd/section-91.171)
  * VOT: +/- 4 deg
    * Can be checked on the ground or in the air, as indicated in the chart supplement for that facility
  * Ground checkpoint: +/- 4 deg
  * Airborne checkpoint: +/- 6 deg
  * Dual check: within 4 deg
* Can find VOT facilities and VOR checkpoints in the chart supplement.
* Log the results of the VOR accuracy test in the aircraft logbook or other record including the **PADS** acronym:
  * **P** - Place
  * **A** - Accuracy (bearing error)
  * **D** - Date
  * **S** - Signature
* VOT is the most convenient way to perform a VOR check if your home airport happens to have one
* Similarly, ground checkpoints are also a convenient option

## VOR Ground Checkpoint

* Has a sign in front of the arrow with the radial and frequency

## VOT Check

* A VOT is a facility located at certain airports that emits a signal that can be used to test a plane's VOR receiver
* The VOT signals are generally designed to be used while on the ground, but some are designated as usable in air, with certain restrictions
* This information can be found in the chart supplement
* Dial a course of 180&#176; in using the OBS, should see the needle center (within +/- 4 degrees) with a `TO` indication.
