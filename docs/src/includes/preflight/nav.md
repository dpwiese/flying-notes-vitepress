# Navigation Equipment Preflight Check

* Two primary systems to check
  * GPS
  * VOR
* Check system status indication as applicable
* No annunciators
* GPS correctly shows location
  * Check databases
    * See table in [AIM Table 1-1-6](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_1.html#ffAks301atcn)
    * ==Databases need not be current, but during enroute you must check each point in the aircraft GPS against a source that is current, e.g. Foreflight and make sure none of the points have changed==
    * ==Same with using GPS for approach - need to make sure approach hasn't changed or been amended since your database date, even if your database is out-of-date==
    * =="Verification of correctness"==
  * Check RAIM
    * Will we have adequate satellite coverage
* Review VOR test sheet is within 30 days and in spec
  * Date
  * Place
  * Bearing error
  * Signature
