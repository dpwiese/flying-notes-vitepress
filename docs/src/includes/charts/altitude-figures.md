# Altitude Figures

* **Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF)**
  * Figure on a sectional that represents the highest elevation within a quadrant, including terrain and other vertical obstacles (towers, trees, etc.). A quadrant on Sectionals is the area bounded by ticked lines dividing each 30 minutes of latitude and each 30 minutes of longitude. MEF figures are calculated as follows:
  * Find the highest point in the quadrant (manmade or natural) and take the highest of the following:
    * If it is a manmade structure, add 100 ft to account for error, then round up
    * If it is natural, add 100 ft for error, add another 200 ft for obstacles which might exist but are low enough they don't require portrayal on the chart, then round up.

*For example consider the following figure. The highest terrain is 3150 ft. There is a manmade obstacle that is 424 ft tall, which has an MSL height of 3284 ft (thus it is sitting on terrain of 2860 ft.) To calculate the MEF using the (known) manmade obstacle (which is the highest point in the quadrant) add 100 ft for error and round up, giving 3300 ft. However, there could be a manmade obstacle of up to 200 ft sitting on the terrain of 3150 ft (that is not required to be portrayed.) Using this to calculate the MEF, add 200 ft to the terrain, and 100 ft for error, then round up giving: 3150 + 200 + 100 = 3450 -> 3500 ft. Thus the MEF is 3500 ft.*

* There are many other minimum altitudes that pertain to IFR flight not discussed here.
  * See CFII TSA document
* Minimum safe altitudes see: [14 CFR &sect;91.119 - Minimum safe altitudes: General](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.119)
  * **Anywhere** - An altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface.
  * **Over congested areas** - Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.
  * **Over other than congested areas** - An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.
* Acrobatics must be done no lower than 1,500 AGL and with 3 miles of visibility.
