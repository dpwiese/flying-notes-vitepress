# Proper and Current Charts

* Motivating examples
  * In Aviation Adventures there was a printed taxi diagram of KHEF posted on the wall that was quite old and different from the current taxi diagram
  * San Francisco Bay Area airspace has changed a lot since I first flew there in 2011 to a decade later
* Before a flight, PIC must become familiar with all available information concerning that flight.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.103 - Preflight action](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.103)
* This information must include:
  * For a flight under IFR or a flight not in the vicinity of an airport
    * Weather reports and forecasts
    * Fuel requirements
    * Alternatives available if the planned flight cannot be completed
    * Any known traffic delays of which the pilot in command has been advised by ATC
  * For any flight
    * Runway lengths at airports of intended use
    * Aircraft performance information under expected values of airport elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind and temperature.
* The above list though is not comprehensive
  * Route of flight and altitude
  * Airspace
  * Obstacles
  * Airport environment at destination (taxi destination)
  * Planned instrument approach procedures and potential alternate approaches that might be likely
  * NOTAMs
