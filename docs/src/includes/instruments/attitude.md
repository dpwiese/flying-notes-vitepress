# Attitude Indicator

* Also known as artificial horizon
* Principles
  * Rigidity in space
  * Precession
* Electrically or vacuum powered
  * What is in POH might have changed and need to consult supplements
  * For example, the Garmin G5 attitude indicator uses solid state (electrically powered) gyro instead of vacuum powered.
* Due to friction, gyroscopic instruments can drift and need to be reset periodically (for example heading indicator to compass)
  * For example, check and reset every 15 minutes
* Certain gyroscopic instruments have specific pitch and bank limits that induce a tumble of the gyro.
* Modern systems such as G5 or G1000 use solid-state devices instead of spinning gyros to determine the aircraft attitude
