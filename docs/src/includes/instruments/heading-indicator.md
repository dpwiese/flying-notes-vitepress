# Heading Indicator / Horizontal Situation Indicator / Radio Magnetic Indicator

* **Heading indicator**
  * Also known as **directional gyro**
  * Usually powered by the aircraft vacuum system
  * Gyroscopic rigidity keeps them fixed in space, but need to be periodically set to the compass
  * Errors in compass make it hard to use to turn to specific headings, especially in turbulent air - heading indicator helps with this
  * Some heading indicators referred to as **horizontal situation indicators** (HSI) receive a magnetic north reference from a magnetic slaving transmitter and generally need no adjustment.
    * See also: remote indicating compass
* **Radio magnetic indicator** (RMI)
* Modern systems use an Altitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) to determine the aircrafts heading that incorporate a magnetometer in them
