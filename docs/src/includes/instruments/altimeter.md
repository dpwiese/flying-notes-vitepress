# Altimeter

* The indicated altitude is correct, however, only when the sea level barometric pressure is standard (29.92 inHg), the sea level free air temperature is standard (15 &#176;C or 59 &#176;F), and the pressure and temperature decrease at a standard rate with an increase in altitude.
* Can adjust the altimeter for nonstandard pressure but not temperature
  * True altitude thus varies with temperature
  * Higher temps means true altitude is higher than indicated and lower temps means true altitude is lower than indicated
  * Recall "hot-to-cold look out below"
  * Beware obstacle clearance especially when flying in colder temps
* Mental model: altimeter setting provides true datum at ground level of the reporting station. Then consider the pressure gradient (which decreases with altitude). Compared to the standard pressure gradient, the pressure gradient in colder more dense air will decrease more quickly, and in hot air the pressure gradient will decrease less quickly.

* Reads within 75 feet of field elevation when set to local altimeter setting
