# Flight Management System (FMS)

* ==A Flight Management System (FMS) automates the tasks of managing the onboard navigation systems==
* A FMS is not a navigation system in itself
* Aggregates sources of position data to determine best actual position
* Simplifies entering of of waypoint information
  * ==Instead of latitude/longitude coordinates use a database of predefined waypoints==
* An FMS uses an electronic database of worldwide navigational data including navigation aids, airways and intersections, Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), STARs, and Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) together with pilot input through a CDU to create a flight plan.
* The FMS provides outputs to several aircraft systems including desired track, bearing and distance to the active waypoint, lateral course deviation and related data to the flight guidance system for the HSI displays, and roll steering command for the autopilot/flight director system.
* This allows outputs from the FMS to command the airplane where to go and when and how to turn.
