* IFR low chart is used under 18,000 ft.
* Victor airways - from 1200 AGL up to but not including FL 180
* Airways are 4 miles each side of centerline
* T-Routes - like victor airways but for GPS navigation on IFR low charts
  * On IFR high charts these are Q-Routes
* See [GPS Routes](/cfi/tsa/nav-systems-radar-services#gps-routes)
* Blue or green airports on IFR chart have instrument approach procedure (IAP) and/or radar minima, where this is related to ASR or PAR (radar) approaches
