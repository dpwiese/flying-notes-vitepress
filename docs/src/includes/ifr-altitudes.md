# IFR Altitudes

* ==**Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA)**==
  * ==Ensures acceptable nav signal coverage and meets obstacle clearance requirements==
    * ==1,000' in non-mountainous areas, 2,000' in mountainous areas==
  * ==Ensures radio communication==
  * ==Does not guarantee radar coverage==
* ==**Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA)**==
  * ==Meets obstacle clearance requirements==
  * ==Ensure acceptable navigation signal only within 22 nm of VOR==
  * ==Only published when it is lower than the MEA==
* ==**Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA)**==
  * ==Lowest altitude at crossing point when going to a higher MEA, indicated on chart by flag with x.==
* ==**Minimum Reception Altitude (MRA)**==
  * ==Lowest altitude at which an intersection can be determined.==
* ==**Maximum Authorized Altitude (MAA)**==
  * ==Maximum altitude that ensures adequate reception of navigation aid signals.==
* **Off-Route Obstruction Clearance Altitude (OROCA)**
  * OROCA is computed just as the Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF) found on Visual Flight Rule (VFR) Charts except that it provides an additional vertical buffer of 1,000 feet in designated non-mountainous areas and a 2,000 foot vertical buffer in designated mountainous areas within the United States.
  * Does not guarantee nav aid or radio reception.
* **Minimum Turning Altitude (MTA)**
  * Minimum turning altitude (MTA) is a charted altitude providing vertical and lateral obstruction clearance based on turn criteria over certain fixes, NAVAIDs, waypoints, and on charted route segments.
* **Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA)**
  * This altitude is not published, but something ATC has (and can be requested if you want to know)
  * Lowest altitude a controller can issue a clearance for
  * For example, if would like vectors for a visual approach, this is the lowest altitude they can clear you too, so if it's not below the ceiling won't work for visual approach
  * Provides 1,000 feet of clearance above the highest obstacle in non-mountainous areas and 2,000 feet above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas
* **Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF)**
  * On VFR charts.
* **Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)**
  * In designated mountainous areas, 2,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 NM from the course to be flown
  * Other than mountainous areas, 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 NM from the course to be flown
  * Or as otherwise authorized by the Administrator or assigned by ATC
  * Mountainous areas are defined in [14 &sect;CFR 95.13 Eastern United States Mountainous Area](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-95/subpart-B/section-95.13) and other parts within [14 &sect;CFR 95 Subpart B Designated Mountainous Areas](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-95/subpart-B?toc=1)
* **Changeover point**
  * When to change from one navaid to another
