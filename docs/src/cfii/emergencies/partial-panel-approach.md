# Partial Panel Approach

This page covers *Task B. Approach With Loss of Primary Flight Instrument Indicators* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Purpose

Be able to still fly an approach and land in IMC even primary flight instruments become inoperative.

## Elements

### Partial Panel

* Use timed / compass turns as required
* Use magnetic compass / turn coordinator / GPS for heading
* Use airspeed / VSI / altimeter for pitch
* Request a "no-gyro" approach if necessary
  * Radar approach
  * Half standard rate turns
* Zoom in on MFD moving map and keep airplane on magenta line

### Timed and Compass Turns

* Timed turns used for turns of less than 60&#176;
* Compass turns used for turns of more than 60&#176;
* =="Times 3 minus 3"==
  * Take the leading digit of the heading change, multiply it by 3 and sutract 3 to get the number of seconds to hold the 15&#176; bank turn
  * For example, to turn 30&#176; (3&times;3=9, 9&minus;3=6) roll into a 15&#176; degree turn and hold for 6 seconds then roll out
* For compass turns, the lead/lag depends on the latitude
  * Using 30&#176; for the US works well enough
  * Including the standard roll-out lead when turning results in the table seen in the Aviation Adventures procedures guide
* From [FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf):

    > With an angle of bank between 15&#176; and 18&#176;, the amount of lead or lag to be used when turning to northerly or southerly headings varies with, and is approximately equal to, the latitude of the locality over which the turn is being made. When turning to a heading of north, the lead for roll-out must include the number of degrees of change of latitude, plus the lead normally used in recovery from turns. During a turn to a south heading, maintain the turn until the compass passes south the number of degrees of latitude, minus normal rollout lead.

* Applying the above is dependent on latitude and normal rollout lead that depends on bank angle, and various rules-of-thumb exist for how much rollout lead should be used.
* For typical single-engine IFR trainers like the Piper Archer or Cessna 172, a 5&#176; rollout lead is reasonable.
* For flight training conducted in the southern United States, 30&#176; latitude can be assumed.
* Applying the rules above with some simplifications and interpolating between the cardinal directions gives the following diagram that should be committed to memory for use in planes where backup heading information is provided by a compass.

* For example, if you are flying east and are making a turn to north, roll out when the compass indicates 35&#176; *before* the desired heading, or in this example when the compass reads 35&#176;.
* If you are are flying east and making a turn to south, roll out when the compass indicates 25&#176; *after* the desired heading, or in this example when the compass reads 205&#176;.
