# Turns

This page covers *Task B. Turns* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Purpose

To develop ability to fly level turns under instrument conditions, both with full and partial panel.

## Elements

* Bug heading
* Roll into a 15&#176; bank turn using rudder to stay coordinated
  * Keep pitch dot on horizon
* Roll out 5&#176; before desired heading
  * Heading bug is 10&#176; wide - edge of heading bug is 5&#176;
* **Primary and supporting instruments for turning flight**
  * **Primary**
    * Altitude
      * Altimeter
    * Heading
      * Attitude indicator (we using 15&#176; bank instead of standard rate)
    * Speed
      * Airspeed indicator
  * **Supporting**
    * Altitude
      * VSI
      * Attitude indicator
    * Heading
      * Turn coordinator
    * Airspeed
      * Tach / manifold pressure
* When targeting a standard rate turn (as opposed to the 15&#176; bank) the above instruments would differ upon turn entry and when established in the turn, where the turn coordinator would become primary once established
