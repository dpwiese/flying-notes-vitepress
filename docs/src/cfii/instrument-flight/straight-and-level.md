# Straight-and-Level Flight

This page covers *Task A. Straight-and-Level Flight* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Purpose

To develop ability to fly straight-and-level under instrument conditions, both with full and partial panel.

## Elements

* Two methods of performing attitude instrument flight
  * **Control and Performance Method**
    * Aircraft performance is accomplished by controlling the aircraft attitude and power output
    * Instruments broken up into control, performance, and navigation
    * ==Set the power and attitude, then monitor the performance and make adjustments==
  * **==Primary and Supporting Method==**
    * ==Focuses more on the instruments that depict the most accurate indication for the aspect of the aircraft attitude being controlled==
    * All changes to aircraft attitude need to be made using the attitude indicator and the power instruments
* **==Primary and supporting instruments for straight-and-level flight==**
  * **Primary**
    * Altitude
      * Altimeter
    * Heading
      * Heading indicator
    * Speed
      * Airspeed indicator
  * **Supporting**
    * Altitude
      * VSI
      * Attitude indicator
    * Heading
      * Turn coordinator
      * Attitude indicator
    * Airspeed
      * Tach / manifold pressure
* Primary vs secondary instruments
  * Example of primary instruments during straight-and-level flight:
    * Altimeter for altitude
    * Heading indicator for bank
    * Airspeed for power
  * Example when establishing a turn:
    * Attitude indicator is primary for bank
    * Turn coordinator is secondary for bank
* Power vs control instruments

### Climbs / Descents

* Enrich, pitch, power, trim
* Climb / descend then turn

### Partial Panel

* Use magnetic compass / turn coordinator / GPS for heading
* Use airspeed / VSI / altimeter for pitch
* Zoom in on MFD moving map and keep airplane on magenta line
