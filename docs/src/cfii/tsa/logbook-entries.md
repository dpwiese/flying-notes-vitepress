## Endorsements

* Instrument knowledge or practical test
* Knowledge test deficiency review and 3 hours flight training in the 2 calendar months before practical test
* Endorsement to retest after failure (either knowledge or practical)
* Keep date, name of student, test, and result for 3 years
* Note: put flight reviews and IPCs in IACRA

## Preparation of a Recommendation for an Instrument Rating Practical Test

* Requirements under Part 61 are in [14 CFR &sect;61.65 Instrument rating requirements](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-B/section-61.65)
* [FAA-AC-61-65J Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1043278) gives the two required endorsements
  * One says the pilot has received the required training and is ready to take the test
  * The other says the pilot has received the required training within 2 months of the practical test, and that we have reviewed deficiencies on knowledge test
* Requirements under 141
  * 35 hours of flight training instrument time
    * Includes 14 training device hours

## Required Logbook Endorsement for Satisfactory Completion of an IPC {#ipc-required-logbook-endorsement}

* [FAA-AC-61-65J Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1043278) gives the required endorsement upon satisfactory completion of an IPC
  * No logbook entry reflecting unsatisfactory performance is required - just log it as dual given
  * [FAA-AC-61-98E Currency Requirements and Guidance for the Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_61-98E.pdf)
  * See also Instrument ACS for IPC requirements

### IPC Overview

The flight instructor determines that the pilot has adequate knowledge and understanding of the following areas:

1. Instrument en route and approach chart interpretation
    * Standard Instrument Departures (SID)
    * Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP)
    * Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STAR)
    * Area Navigation (RNAV) / Global Positioning System (GPS) / wide area augmentation system (WAAS) procedures
2. Obtaining and analyzing weather information
    * Including knowledge of hazardous weather phenomena, such as icing and convective activity.
3. Preflight planning, including
    * Aircraft performance
    * Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) information (including temporary flight restrictions (TFR))
    * Fuel requirements
    * Alternate requirements
    * Use of appropriate FAA publications such as the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD)
4. Aircraft systems related to IFR operations, including appropriate operating methods, limitations, and emergency procedures due to equipment failure.
5. Aircraft flight instruments and navigation equipment, including characteristics, limitations, operating techniques, and emergency procedures due to malfunction or failure, such as lost communications and automation failure procedures.
6. Determining the airworthiness of the aircraft for instrument flight, including required inspections and documents.
7. Air traffic control (ATC) procedures pertinent to flight under IFR, with emphasis on elements of ATC clearances and pilot/controller responsibilities.
8. A general working knowledge of aerodynamic principles relating to angle of attack (AOA) and the purpose, operation, and limitations of AOA indicators (if installed).

  * See also Instrument ACS for IPC requirements
* An IPC is required when instrument currency lapses, where instrument currency is maintained by the following in last 6 months
* Instrument currency requirements (**66 HIT**)
  * [14 CFR 61.57(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57#p-61.57(c))
  * Per aircraft ***category***
    * e.g. airplane, helicopter
  * Within preceding **6 calendar months**
    * **6** - Six instrument approaches
    * **H** - Holding procedures and tasks
    * **I** - Intercepting and
    * **T** - Tracking courses through the use of navigational electronic systems

## Required Flight Instructor Records

* [14 CFR &sect;61.189 Flight instructor records](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-H/section-61.189)
* Sign logbook of pilot any time flight training is given
* In addition to requirements for CFI (e.g. citizenship verification, knowledge and practical test endorsements, solo endorsements) CFII also needs to keep record of knowledge and practical test endorsements for instrument exams
* Need to keep the records for 3 years
