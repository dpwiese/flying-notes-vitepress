## Flight Instrument Systems and Their Operating Characteristics

### Pitot-Static System

<!--@include: ./docs/src/includes/instruments/airspeed.md | shift:3-->

#### Failure modes

* Alternate static source
  * Due to the venturi effect of the air flowing around the fuselage, *the air pressure inside the flight deck is lower* than the exterior pressure.

### Primary Flight Display {#task-a-1-i}

PFDs provide increased situational awareness (SA) to the pilot by replacing the traditional six instruments used for instrument flight with an easy-to-scan display that provides the horizon, airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, trend, trim, rate of turn among other key relevant indications.

  * Chapter 2: The Air Traffic Control System
    * Page 2-3: Radar and Transponders

* A transponder is a radar beacon transmitter/receiver installed in the instrument panel.
* ATC beacon transmitters send out interrogation signals continuously as the radar antenna rotates.
* When an interrogation is received by a transponder, a coded reply is sent to the ground station where it is displayed on the controller's scope.
* A reply light on the transponder panel flickers every time it receives and replies to a radar interrogation. Transponder codes are assigned by ATC.

* Mode C sends *pressure altitude* to ATC
  * Adjusting the altimeter's Kollsman window has no effect on the altitude read by the controller.
  * A transponder code consists of four numbers from 0 to 7 (4,096 possible codes)
* Mode S offers improvements over Mode C
  * 24-bit addresses instead of 4-bit
  * Transmits more data
    * Aircraft Collision Avoidance System (ACAS)
    * Heading, roll angle, etc.

    * Page 5-27: Primary Flight Display
* See [Task A.1.I. Primary Flight Display](#task-a-1-i) for more information

### Automatic Pilot

* Electrically powered actuators connected to primary flight controls
  * 2-axis: roll and pitch
* Basic control system that can automatically fly a flight path

### Flight Management System (FMS)

* [FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf)
  * Chapter 5: Flight Instruments
    * Page 5-26: Flight Management Systems (FMS)

* An FMS uses an electronic database of worldwide navigational data including navigation aids, airways and intersections, Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), STARs, and Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) together with pilot input through a CDU to create a flight plan.
* The FMS provides outputs to several aircraft systems including desired track, bearing and distance to the active waypoint, lateral course deviation and related data to the flight guidance system for the HSI displays, and roll steering command for the autopilot/flight director system.
* This allows outputs from the FMS to command the airplane where to go and when and how to turn.

## Radar / Lightning Detection System

* Radar weather can be either onboard or ground-based, and transmitted to the aircraft.
  * Onboard weather radar systems
    * Onboard weather radar uses an adjustable aircraft mounted radar antenna to detect, in real time, weather phenomena near the aircraft.
    * You must be careful not to assume that the only cells in the area are the ones shown on the radar display.
    * When a cell is detected by an onboard weather radar system, that cell often absorbs or reflects all of the radio signals sent out by the radar system. This phenomenon, called attenuation, prevents the radar from detecting any additional cells that might lie behind the first cell.
  * Ground weather surveillance radar
    * Ground weather surveillance integrates weather information from many ground radar stations.
    * The weather information collected from many sources is then used to create a composite picture that covers large volumes of airspace.
    * These composite radar images can then be transmitted to aircraft equipped with weather data receivers.
  * Limitations
    * Weather radar does not detect most other kinds of hazardous weather such as fog, icing, and turbulence.
    * A second limitation of weather radar is that the earliest (cumulus) stage of a thunderstorm is usually free of precipitation and may not be detected by radar.
* Lightning detection
  * Can also come from source onboard the aircraft or on the ground
  * An onboard lightning detection system consists of a simple antenna and processing unit that senses electrical discharges in the atmosphere and attempts to determine which electromagnetic signals have the "signature" of lightning strikes.
  * See Stormscope and Strikefinder as examples
