# Intercepting, Tracking, and DME Arcs

This page covers *Task A. Intercepting and Tracking Navigational Systems and DME Arcs* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Purpose

Use ground-based navigation systems to perform en-route navigation, and perform proper procedure to fly a DME arc.

## Elements

* Normal VOR is 10&#176; full-scale deflection from center to either side
* When setting course using OBS, it should match the intended course to be flown rather than the reciprocal
* If plane has HSI, keep the top of CDI needle on the lubber line to intercept
* On planes without HSI
  * Full needle deflection use 45&#176; intercept angle
  * Partial needle deflection use 30&#176; intercept angle

Note from (the older) [FAA-S-ACS-8B](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_acs_change_1.pdf) regarding DME arcs:

> While the applicant is expected to be able to fly DME Arcs, they may be selected for testing only if they are
charted and available.

The language changed in the more recent [FAA-S-ACS-8C](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_airplane_acs_8.pdf):

> The evaluator may not select DME arcs, unless charted and available (including use of RNAV substitution techniques, if
appropriate).
