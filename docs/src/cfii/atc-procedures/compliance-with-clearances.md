# Compliance with Clearances

This page covers *Task B: Compliance with Departure, En Route, and Arrival Procedures and Clearances* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Selection and use of current and appropriate navigation publications

* This is made easier by modern electronic flight bags and apps like Foreflight
* Make sure to always use current publications
* Have access to publications you may need during flight
* Know in which publications to find legends and other information you might need

## Pilot and controller responsibilities with regard to DPs, En Route Low and High Altitude Charts, and STARs

See [Standard Instrument Departures/Terminal Arrivals](/cfii/tsa/regulations-publications#standard-instrument-departures-terminal-arrivals)

## Selection and use of appropriate communications frequencies

* Departure frequency given with CRAFT clearance
* Check frequencies before takeoff
* "No dead frequencies"

## Selection and identification of the navigation aids

* Have morse code chart handy if your avionics does not automatically ID the navaid

## Accomplishment of the appropriate checklist items

* Follow checklist according to aircraft manufacturer

## Pilot's responsibility for compliance with vectors and also altitude, airspeed, climb, descent, and airspace restrictions

* ==Vectors are headings not course==
* Need at least 500 fpm climb
* Level of from descent 100 feet above target altitude to avoid going below

## Pilot's responsibility for the interception of courses, radials, and bearings appropriate to the procedure, route, or clearance

* If there is a delay getting FMS set up to adhere to ATC instructions, ask for vectors to buy time

## Procedures to be used in the event of two-way communications failure

## The uses of the multifunction display and other graphical navigational displays, if installed, to monitor position track, wind drift, and other parameters to maintain situational awareness and desired flightpath

* Use the MFD and moving map for situational awareness
* In the event of loss of flight instruments, can zoom in on the moving map and magenta line and use that for course guidance
