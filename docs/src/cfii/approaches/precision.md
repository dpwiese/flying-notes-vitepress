# Precision Approach

This page covers *Task B. Precision Instrument Approach (PA)* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Completion Standards

Note from (the older) [FAA-S-ACS-8B](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_acs_change_1.pdf) regarding the use of LPV approaches in lieu of an ILS:

> Localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) minimums with a decision altitude (DA) greater than 300 feet height above touchdown (HAT) may be used as a nonprecision approach; however, due to the precision of its glidepath and localizer-like lateral navigation characteristics, an LPV minimums approach can be used to demonstrate precision approach proficiency if the DA is equal to or less than 300 feet HAT.

The language changed in the more recent [FAA-S-ACS-8C](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_airplane_acs_8.pdf):

> The applicant must accomplish a precision approach to the decision altitude (DA) using aircraft navigational equipment for centerline and vertical guidance in simulated or actual instrument meteorological conditions. A precision approach is a standard instrument approach procedure to a published decision altitude using provided approved vertical guidance.
