# Missed Approach

This page covers *Task C. Missed Instrument Approach (PA)* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Purpose

Important to know how to properly fly a missed approach procedure, as it may not always be the case that you can land from an approach.
Additionally, during training nearly all approaches will terminate with the missed approach procedure to save time

## Elements

* Run 5 C's
  * Power full
  * Pitch up to 10 degrees
    * This is in part because during descent the pilot's "head gyros" are "calibrated" to the 3 degree descent
  * Flaps up, landing and taxi light off
  * Suspend GPS
  * Make radio call
* Immediately go missed if full-scale deflection on either needle
* Don't turn before MAP
* Missed while circling approach
  * Turn towards approach end of runway and join missed approach procedure

### Missed Approach Procedures

* **==Missed approach (5 C's)==**
  * **==Cram==**
    * Throttle full
  * **==Climb==**
    * Pitch up and establish climb
  * **==Clean==**
    * Flaps up
    * Lights (landing, taxi, strobes) off
  * **==Click==**
    * Press suspend button
    * Verify CDI source is correct (pink needles)
    * Verify approach has sequenced to next leg
  * **==Confess==**
    * Last call on CTAF
    * Back to approach to coordinate next intention
* Immediately go missed if full-scale deflection on either needle
* If on a circling approach you re-enter clouds you must go missed
* Don't turn before MAP
* Missed while circling approach
  * Turn towards approach end of runway and join missed approach procedure
