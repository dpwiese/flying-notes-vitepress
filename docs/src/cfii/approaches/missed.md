# Missed Approach

This page covers *Task C. Missed Instrument Approach (PA)* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Purpose

Important to know how to properly fly a missed approach procedure, as it may not always be the case that you can land from an approach.
Additionally, during training nearly all approaches will terminate with the missed approach procedure to save time.
