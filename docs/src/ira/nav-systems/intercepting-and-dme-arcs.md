# Intercepting and Tracking Navigational Systems and DME Arcs

This page covers *Task A. Intercepting and Tracking Navigational Systems and DME Arcs* from the [FAA-S-ACS-8C Instrument Rating Airplane Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_airplane_acs_8.pdf).

## Objective

To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with intercepting and tracking navigation aids and arcs solely by reference to instruments.

Note from (the older) [FAA-S-ACS-8B](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_acs_change_1.pdf) regarding DME arcs:

> While the applicant is expected to be able to fly DME Arcs, they may be selected for testing only if they are charted and available.

The language changed in the more recent [FAA-S-ACS-8C](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_airplane_acs_8.pdf):

> The evaluator may not select DME arcs, unless charted and available (including use of RNAV substitution techniques, if appropriate).
