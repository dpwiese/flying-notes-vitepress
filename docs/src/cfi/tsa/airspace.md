## Airspace Requirements

### VFR Weather Minimums

* [14 CFR &sect;91.155 - Basic VFR weather minimums](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.155)
  * The exception noted in the figure below in G airspace within 1200 AGL:

    > Airplane, powered parachute, or weight-shift-control aircraft. If the visibility is less than 3 statute miles but not less than 1 statute mile during night hours and you are operating in an airport traffic pattern within 1⁄2 mile of the runway, you may operate an airplane, powered parachute, or weight-shift-control aircraft clear of clouds.

![VFR weather minimums. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 15: Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/17_phak_ch15.pdf) Figure 15-8](/img/vfr-weather-minimums.png){width=800}

### Two-Way Radio Communication

* ***Two-way radio communication requirement is met when ATC uses your aircraft ID (tail number or callsign).***
* For example, if ATC says "aircraft calling standby" this does *not* constitute two-way communication.
* If ATC says "N12345 standby" that does.
* [14 CFR &sect;91.129(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.129#p-91.129(c)(1)) says:

    > Each person must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility (including foreign ATC in the case of foreign airspace designated in the United States) providing air traffic services prior to entering that airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within that airspace.

* Communication with TRACON or Center on flight following does not satisfy the requirement to fly through Class D, as neither of these is the Class D tower, which is the facility controlling that airspace.
* However [JO 7110.65AA 2−1−16(b)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap2_section_1.html#C8I3b6JACK) says:

    > Coordinate with the appropriate control tower for transit authorization when you are providing radar traffic advisory service to an aircraft that will enter another facility's airspace.

    > NOTE - The pilot is not expected to obtain his/her own authorization through each area when in contact with a radar facility.

* [AIM 3-2-1(d)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-1) says:

    > VFR Requirements. It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that ATC clearance or radio communication requirements are met prior to entry into Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace. The pilot retains this responsibility when receiving ATC radar advisories. (See 14 CFR Part 91.)

* Therefore, there is some ambiguity about whose responsibility it is
* This was clarified in the [Air Traffic Procedures Bulletin October 2017](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/atpb_october_2017.pdf)
* This bulletin provides guidance to controllers as to how they can help coordinate
* The [Granby 2006 Legal Interpretation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2006/Granby_2006_Legal_Interpretation.pdf) additionally states that, with respect to C airspace, TRACON is *the* controlling agency
  * *Note: can find a list of FAA Legal interpretation letters at the [FAA Regulations Division Legal Interpretations & Chief Counsel's Opinions](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/) page*
* ***Ultimately, it is the pilot's job to check when on flight following whether a switchover to tower is required before flying through C or D airspace, or whether ATC has already coordinated.***

### Airspace Speed Limits

* Defined in [14 CFR &sect;91.117 - Aircraft speed](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.117)
  * Below 10,000' MSL: 250 KIAS
  * For C and D airspace, within 4 nm and within 2,500 AGL of the primary airport: 200 KIAS
  * Under or through (VFR cooridor) B airspace: 200 KIAS
  * These limits can be exceeded if safety requires it
* Speed limits are in *indicated airspeed*

![Airspace speed limits. (unknown reference)](/img/airspace_speed_limits.jpg){width=540}

### Overlapping Airspace

* As an example, see some airspace around `KBFI` and `KSEA` -- there is D airspace that extends upwards into B.
* See [14 CFR &sect;71.9 - Overlapping airspace designations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-71/section-71.9):

  > When overlapping airspace designations apply to the same airspace, the operating rules associated with the more restrictive airspace designation apply.

* See also [AIM 3-1-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_1.html#$paragraph3-1-3) which also clarifies what is meant by the relative level of "restrictiveness" of the airspace classes.

## Special VFR Requirements

* Provides IFR separation even though not doing IFR operation
* Must be requested by pilot and approved by ATC
* Need 1 SM visibility and clear of clouds
* If at night, pilot and plane need to be instrument rated
* Can do in controlled airspace up to 10,000 MSL (something about airspace to ground?)
* If ground visibility not reported, just need 1 SM flight visibility
* Some airports do not permit special VFR
* *Q: Is there any real reason to ever do special VFR? It seems dumb.*
* [14 CFR &sect;91.157 - Special VFR weather minimums](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.157)
  * During the day, SVFR requires
    * ATC clearance
    * 1 SM visibility
    * Clear of clouds
  * At night, the pilot must be instrument rated and the aircraft must be IFR equipped.
