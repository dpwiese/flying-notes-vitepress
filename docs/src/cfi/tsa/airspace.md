# National Airspace System

This page covers *Task G. National Airspace System* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Airspace Classes

![VFR airspace entry requirements. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 15: Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/17_phak_ch15.pdf) Figure 15-9](/img/vfr-entry-requirements.png){width=800}

### VFR Weather Minimums

![VFR weather minimums. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 15: Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/17_phak_ch15.pdf) Figure 15-8](/img/vfr-weather-minimums.png){width=800}

### Two-Way Radio Communication

* ***Two-way radio communication requirement is met when ATC uses your aircraft ID (tail number or callsign).***
* For example, if ATC says "aircraft calling standby" this does *not* constitute two-way communication.
* If ATC says "N12345 standby" that does.
* [14 CFR &sect;91.129(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.129#p-91.129(c)(1)) says:

    > Each person must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility (including foreign ATC in the case of foreign airspace designated in the United States) providing air traffic services prior to entering that airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within that airspace.

* Communication with TRACON or Center on flight following does not satisfy the requirement to fly through Class D, as neither of these is the Class D tower, which is the facility controlling that airspace.
* However [JO 7110.65AA 2−1−16(b)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap2_section_1.html#C8I3b6JACK) says:

    > Coordinate with the appropriate control tower for transit authorization when you are providing radar traffic advisory service to an aircraft that will enter another facility's airspace.

    > NOTE - The pilot is not expected to obtain his/her own authorization through each area when in contact with a radar facility.

* [AIM 3-2-1(d)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-1) says:

    > VFR Requirements. It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that ATC clearance or radio communication requirements are met prior to entry into Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace. The pilot retains this responsibility when receiving ATC radar advisories. (See 14 CFR Part 91.)

* Therefore, there is some ambiguity about whose responsibility it is
* This was clarified in the [Air Traffic Procedures Bulletin October 2017](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/atpb_october_2017.pdf)
* This bulletin provides guidance to controllers as to how they can help coordinate
* The [Granby 2006 Legal Interpretation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2006/Granby_2006_Legal_Interpretation.pdf) additionally states that, with respect to C airspace, TRACON is *the* controlling agency
  * *Note: can find a list of FAA Legal interpretation letters at the [FAA Regulations Division Legal Interpretations & Chief Counsel's Opinions](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/) page*
* ***Ultimately, it is the pilot's job to check when on flight following whether a switchover to tower is required before flying through C or D airspace, or whether ATC has already coordinated.***

### Special VFR

* Provides IFR separation even though not doing IFR operation
* Must be requested by pilot and approved by ATC
* Need 1 SM visibility and clear of clouds
* If at night, pilot and plane need to be instrument rated
* Can do in controlled airspace up to 10,000 MSL (something about airspace to ground?)
* If ground visibility not reported, just need 1 SM flight visibility
* Some airports do not permit special VFR
* *Q: Is there any real reason to ever do special VFR? It seems dumb.*
* [14 CFR &sect;91.157 - Special VFR weather minimums](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.157)
  * During the day, SVFR requires
    * ATC clearance
    * 1 SM visibility
    * Clear of clouds
  * At night, the pilot must be instrument rated and the aircraft must be IFR equipped.

### Controlled Airspace

* **Class A**
  * [AIM 3-2-2](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-2)
  * Above 18,000 feet, FL is used
  * FL180 – FL60
  * Active across entire NAS + 12 nm off the coast
  * Requirements: IFR Flight Plan
  * DME over FL240
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205)
* **Class B**
  * [AIM 3-2-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-3)
  * SFC to 10,000 MSL
  * B = Busy
  * Upside down wedding cake
  * Must be cleared to enter
  * Solid blue line on VFR chart
  * VFR coordidors sometimes exist as small paths through B airspace
* **Class C**
  * [AIM 3-2-4](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-4)
  * Less busy than B, but still high volume of large aircraft
  * SFC to 4,000 MSL
  * 5 nm core, 10 nm radius, where outer shelf starts at 1,200 ft
  * Two-way radio communication to enter (note tail number)
  * Solid magenta line on VFR chart
  * Spacing / separation: [7110.65 Section 8. Class C Service- Terminal 7-8-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap7_section_8.html)
* **Class D**
  * [AIM 3-2-5](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-5)
  * Operating control tower
  * SFC – 2,500 ft
  * 5 sm / 4.4 nm Radius
  * Two-way radio communication to enter
  * Dashed blue line on VFR chart
  * When a D airspace tower closes, the airspace becomes E to surface, unless weather/communication is not available at the surface, then it is E only down to 700.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.129 - Operations in Class D airspace](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.129)
* **Class E**
  * [AIM 3-2-6](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-6)
  * Any controlled airspace that is not A-D
  * Class E airspace below 14,500 feet MSL is charted on Sectional, Terminal, and IFR Enroute Low Altitude charts.
  * *So technically the default is G up to 14,500 unless otherwise charted*
  * ==However, with very few exceptions (see class G airspace below) class E is charted to start at either 700' or 1200' AGL==
    * ==So basically the default is that E starts at 1200' AGL except where charted to start at 700' AGL, or where shown to *not* to start at 1200' AGL.==
    * This can be seen along the US border, where it shows the start of E at 1,200'
  * 700/1200 ft AGL – 18,000 ft MSL (A), up to 12 nm off US coast
  * "1200 ft, except where the elephant steps"
  * VFR chart Colors
    * To surface: dashed magenta
    * 700 ft floor: ombre magenta
    * 1200 ft floor: ombre blue
      * Note: ombre is a French word meaning shaded, where one hue blends to another
* Weather, Aircraft, Pilot Requirements

### Uncontrolled Airspace

* **Class G**
  * [AIM 3-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_3.html)
  * SFC – Base of class E
  * Even though there is no ATC, still minimum requirements to comply with FAA
  * In certain designated areas class G extends up to 14,500 feet
    * This is on VFR charts, but easier to see on IFR charts

![Class G airspace to 14,500 as depicted on IFR charts. [Aeronautical Chart Users' Guide - IFR Enroute Products Only Edition](https://aeronav.faa.gov/user_guide/20220714/cug-ifr-enroute-edition.pdf)](/img/ifr-chart-user-guide-class-g-to-14500.jpg){width=800}

  * The exception noted in the figure below in G airspace within 1200 AGL:

    > Airplane, powered parachute, or weight-shift-control aircraft. If the visibility is less than 3 statute miles but not less than 1 statute mile during night hours and you are operating in an airport traffic pattern within 1⁄2 mile of the runway, you may operate an airplane, powered parachute, or weight-shift-control aircraft clear of clouds.

* [FAA Equip ADS-B](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/equipadsb/)
* [14 CFR &sect;91.225 - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment and use](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.225)

* **Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)**
  * **Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B)**
    * Provides traffic information to planes with ADS-B receivers
    * The traffic includes that which is not broadcasting its own output via ADS-B, because it's able to use radar data and conventional transponder data to understand where aircraft are
  * **Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B)**
    * Provides NEXRAD graphical weather in (for example in G1000)
    * Also provides info on SUA and TFRs
  * ADS-B uses plane's GPS and broadcasts information to other planes and ground stations
  * Ground stations compile and rebroadcast received information

### Airspace Speed Limits

* Defined in [14 CFR &sect;91.117 - Aircraft speed](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.117)
  * Below 10,000' MSL: 250 KIAS
  * For C and D airspace, within 4 nm and within 2,500 AGL of the primary airport: 200 KIAS
  * Under or through (VFR cooridor) B airspace: 200 KIAS
  * These limits can be exceeded if safety requires it
* Speed limits are in *indicated airspeed*

![Airspace speed limits. (unknown reference)](/img/airspace_speed_limits.jpg){width=540}

### Overlapping Airspace

* As an example, see some airspace around `KBFI` and `KSEA` -- there is D airspace that extends upwards into B.
* See [14 CFR &sect;71.9 - Overlapping airspace designations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-71/section-71.9):

  > When overlapping airspace designations apply to the same airspace, the operating rules associated with the more restrictive airspace designation apply.

* See also [AIM 3-1-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_1.html#$paragraph3-1-3) which also clarifies what is meant by the relative level of "restrictiveness" of the airspace classes.

![Overlapping D airspace of `KBFI` extending upwards into `KSEA` B airspace.](/img/overlapping-airspace-seattle-tac.jpg){width=800}

## Chart Symbols

  * ==Flight is not permitted==
  * *E.g. Camp David, White House*
  * Blue on VFR chart
* **Restricted**
  * ==Think "Rockets"==
  * Seperates civilian traffic from potentially hazardous military activities
  * ==Requires permission from ATC ("the controlling agency") to fly through (when active)==
    * Who is the controlling agency?
  * When flying IFR, don't really need to worry about it. ATC will either allow you to operate in the restricted area without an explicit clearance, our route you around it. See [AIM 3-4-3(b)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_4.html#$paragraph3-4-3).
  * ATC can confirm if hot & can provide crossing
  * Blue on VFR chart
