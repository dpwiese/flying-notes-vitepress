## Advisory Circulars, INFOs, and SAFOs

### Advisory Circulars

* An Advisory Circular (AC) is an informational document that the FAA wants to distribute to the aviation community.
* This can be in the form of a text book used in a classroom or a one page document.
  * [FAA-AC-00-6B Aviation Weather](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1029851)
  * [FAA-AC-00-45H Aviation Weather Services](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1030235)
* ACs provide a single, uniform, agency-wide system that the FAA uses to deliver advisory material to FAA customers, industry, the aviation community, and the public.
* An AC may be needed to
  * Provide an acceptable, clearly understood method for complying with a regulation
  * Standardize implementation of a regulation or harmonize implementation for the international aviation community
  * Resolve a general misunderstanding of a regulation
  * Respond to a request from some government entity, such as General Accounting Office, NTSB, or the Office of the Inspector General
  * Help the industry and FAA effectively implement a regulation
  * Explain requirements and limits of an FAA grant program
  * Expand on standards needed to promote aviation safety, including the safe operation of airports
* There are three parts to an AC number, as in 25-42C.
  * The first part of the number identifies the subject matter area of the AC and corresponds to the appropriate 14 CFR part.
    * For example, an Advisory Circular on "Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors" is [FAA-AC-61-65J](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1043278).
    * Since ACs are numbered sequentially within each subject area, the second part of the number beginning with the dash identifies this sequence.
    * The third part of the number is a letter assigned by the originating office and shows the revision sequence if an AC is revised.

### INFOs

* Information for Operators
* [InFO 06001 - Introducing InFOs](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/airports/runway_safety/controllers/resources/inFO06001.pdf)

    > Much like SAFOs, which contain critical safety information, an InFO message contains valuable information for operators that should help them meet certain administrative, regulatory, or operational requirements with relatively low urgency or impact on safety. InFOs contain information or a combination of information and recommended action to be taken by the respective operators identified in each individual InFO.

### SAFOs

* Safety Alerts for Operators
* [SAFO 05001 - Introducing SAFOs](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/SAFO_05001.pdf)

    > The SAFO process re-establishes a communication channel between Flight Standards and operators. This channel permits a policy-making division such as AFS-200 to convey important safety information concurrently to FAA field offices and to operators in a timely manner, without undue delays caused by coordination among government offices. SAFOs frequently contain recommended action to be accomplished by operators.

## ACS and PTS

* The FAA has developed PTS for FAA pilot certificates and associated ratings.
* In 2015, the FAA began transitioning to the ACS approach.
* The ACS is essentially an "enhanced" version of the PTS.
  * It adds task - specific knowledge and risk management elements to each PTS Area of Operation and Task.
* The result is a holistic, integrated presentation of specific knowledge, skills, and risk management elements and performance metrics for each Area of Operation and Task.
* The ACS evaluation program will eventually replace the PTS program for evaluating and certifying pilots.
* The PTS book is a testing document and not intended to be a training syllabus.

## POH and AFM

### FAA Approved Pilot Operating Handbooks / AFM

* Flight manuals and operating handbooks are concise reference books that provide specific information about a particular aircraft or subject.
* They contain basic facts, information, and/or instructions for the pilot about the operation of an aircraft, flying techniques, etc., and are intended to be kept on hand for ready reference.
* The aircraft owner/information manual is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains general information about the make and model of the aircraft.
* The manual is not approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is not specific to an individual aircraft.
* The manual provides general information about the operation of an aircraft, is not kept current, and cannot be substituted for the AFM/POH.

* An AFM is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and approved by the FAA. This book contains the information and instructions required to operate an aircraft safely.
* A pilot must comply with this information which is specific to a particular make and model of aircraft, usually by serial number.
* An AFM contains the operating procedures and limitations of that aircraft.
* Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 requires that pilots comply with the operating limitations specified in the approved flight manuals, markings, and placards.

* Originally, flight manuals followed whatever format and content the manufacturer felt was appropriate, but this changed with the acceptance of Specification No. 1 prepared by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA).
* Specification No. 1 established a standardized format for all general aviation airplane and helicopter flight manuals.

* The POH is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information. If "POH" is used in the main title, a statement must be included on the title page indicating that sections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM.

* The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual. The typical AFM/POH contains the following nine sections
    1. General
    2. Limitations
    3. Emergency Procedures
    4. Normal Procedures
    5. Performance
    6. Weight and Balance/Equipment List
    7. Systems Description
    8. Handling, Service, and Maintenance
    9. Supplements
* Manufacturers also have the option of including additional sections, such as one on Safety and Operational Tips or an alphabetical index at the end of the POH.

### AFM vs POH

* Aircraft owner/information manual is *not* approved by the FAA and is not a substitute for the *approved* POH/AFM
  * The POH is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information.
  * If "POH" is used in the main title, a statement must be included on the title page indicating that sections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM.
  * The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual.
* Manuals follow standard format
* AFM vs POH/PIM
  * AFM regulated by FAA and specific to airplane
  * POH/PIM general aircraft info
  * POH is standardized by the General Aviation Manufacturer's Association
    * [GAMA Specification 1, rev 1996](https://gama.aero/documents/gama-specification-1-specification-for-pilots-operating-handbook-version-2-0/)

    > The title [of the document shall be] "Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual" for all airplanes except those for which the airplane manufacturer elected to provide a separate FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual. In the latter case, the title shall be "Pilot's Operating Handbook".

    > Note: After the effective date of this revision, Pilot's Operating Handbooks for newly manufactured airplanes must be FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manuals.

## Aeronautical Information Manual

* Also known as the AIM
* The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) is the official guide to basic flight information and ATC procedures for the aviation community flying in the NAS of the United States.
