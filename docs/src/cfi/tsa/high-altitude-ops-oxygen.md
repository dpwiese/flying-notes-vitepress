# High Altitude Operations - Supplemental Oxygen

This page covers *Task N. High Altitude Operations - Supplemental Oxygen* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Operational factors

### Importance of Aviator's Breathing Oxygen

* Specified at 99.5% pure oxygen.
* Not more than 0.005 mg of water per liter.
* Medical oxygen-has too much water, which can collect in various parts of the system and freeze, reducing or stopping the flow of oxygen.
* Industrial oxygen-not intended for breathing, may have impurities in it.

### Precautions

* TBD

## Appendix

### Using Oxygen

* Take oxygen gradually to build up in small doses - the sudden supply of pure oxygen following decompression can aggravate hypoxia.
* Prolonged oxygen use can be harmful to health.
* 100% aviation oxygen can create toxic symptoms if used for too long.
  * Symptoms: bronchial cough, fever, vomiting, nervousness, irregular heartbeat, lowered energy.

### Nitrogen

* Decompression sickness-evolving and expanding gases in the body.
  * Trapped gas-expanding/contracting gas in cavities during altitude changes can result in abdominal pain, toothache, or pain in ears and sinuses if the pressure change isn't equalized.
  * Evolved gas-with a sufficient pressure drop, nitrogen forms bubbles which can have adverse effects on some body issues.
  * Scuba diving compounds this problem.
    * See more on scuba in aeromedical factors section

### Vision

* ==Vision becomes impaired with lack of oxygen, especially at night==

### Care and Storage of Oxygen Bottles

Portable oxygen equipment must be accessible in flight if the airplane does not have a fixed installation.
Oxygen usually stored at 1,800-2,200 psi. When the ambient temperature surrounding the cylinder decreases, the pressure within the cylinder will decrease-no reason to suspect supply depletion if you notice a drop in indicated pressure.

Fire danger-materials that are nearly fire proof in ordinary air may be susceptible to burning in pure oxygen. Oils and greases may catch fire if exposed to pure oxygen and cannot be in oxygen systems. Smoking is prohibited during any kind of oxygen equipment use.

Thoroughly inspect and test all oxygen equipment before each flight. Available supply, operational check, assure it is readily available. Do periodic inspections and servicing.

PRICE checklist to inspect oxygen equipment

* **P** - Pressure - is there enough oxygen pressure and quantity to complete the flight
* **R** - Regulator
* **I** - Indicator - check to assure steady flow of oxygen
* **C** - Connections - all secured
* **E** - Emergency - have equipment readily available, brief passengers
