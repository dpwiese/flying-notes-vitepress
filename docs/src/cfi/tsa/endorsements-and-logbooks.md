::: tip
Generally best answer when it comes to questions about endorsements is to consult [FAA-AC-61-65J](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1043278).

## Required Student Pilot Endorsements and Logbook Entries

* [FAA-AC-61-65J](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1043278)
  * This acknowledges that the endorsements it provides are *recommended*, and although it provides recommended or "sample" endorsements beyond the two above (pre-solo knowledge test and pre-solo flight training, as well as citizenship verification) it also seems to make fairly clear that only the 90 day endorsement is required, and the pre-solo knowledge test and flight training are requirements (but that need not bring an endorsement)
* [49 CFR &sect;1552.15(c)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/part-1552#p-1552.15(c)(2))
  * Describes the required citizenship verification endorsement
  * This section was changed on 30-July-2024 to require a citizenship endorsement when previously it did not
  * The diff is [here](https://www.ecfr.gov/compare/2024-07-30/to/2024-07-29/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-XII/subchapter-C/part-1552), with the previously relevant section [49 CFR &sect;1552.3(h) (2024-09-29)](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2024-07-29/title-49/part-1552#p-1552.3(h))
* ==To solo, a student pilot *technically* (as far as I can tell) only *needs* two endorsement: citizenship verification and the initial (and then recurring) 90 day solo endorsement==
  * It provides endorsements and language that ensures consistency with 14 CFR Part 61, and described below is the "standard" endorsements given, even if they do include more endorsements than strictly necessary.
* In the section that follows, the endorsements required to solo are described as if all the endorsements mentioned above *are* required

### Student Pilot Endorsements: Zero-to-Solo

* ==**Citizenship verification (A.14)**==
  * Flight school must verify citizenship before flight training begins
    * [49 CFR &sect;1552.7(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/part-1552#p-1552.7(a))
    * The wording of the CFR has changed, but previously it had said the *flight school* must verify citizenship, but the endorsement sample in [FAA-AC-61-65J](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1043278) says the ==*flight instructor* needs to make the endorsement and keep a copy of the documents proving citizenship for 5 years.==
    * As a flight instructor, it's best to keep your own records of this, even if not strictly required.
  * Can do flight training as non-US citizen, but need TSA approval
    * [Flight Training Security Program (FTSP)](https://www.fts.tsa.dhs.gov/home)
    * [Getting Your Pilot's License as a Non-US Citizen](https://pilotinstitute.com/non-us-citizen-pilot-license/)
    * Check if this is still correct though, as it seems the CFRs have recently changed.
* **Medical and student pilot certificate (No Endoresments Needed)**
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.87 - Solo requirements for student pilots](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87)
  * Before a student solos, they need to have a student pilot certificate and medical (or BasicMed) neither of which are required before to log training received time
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(h) - Logging training time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(h))
  * ==*No instructor endorsement required for student to get student pilot certificate and medical*.==
* ==**Pre-solo knowledge test (A.3)**==
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.87(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87#p-61.87(b))
    * This describes the pre-solo knowledge test requirement, but doesn't specifically state a separate endorsement is required
  * Student's CFI must test knowledge of airspace rules and procedures, and flight characteristics and limitations of make and model of aircraft to be solo'd
  * ==Student's CFI must administer the pre-solo knowledge test, review the answers, and will endorse their logbook.==
* ==**Pre-solo flight training (A.4)**==
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.87(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87#p-61.87(c))
  * CFI must have judged student to be safe
  * Student needs to have received and logged training in maneuvers specified in [14 CFR &sect;61.87(d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87#p-61.87(d))
    * Proper flight preparation procedures, including preflight planning and preparation, powerplant operation, and aircraft systems
    * Taxiing or surface operations, including runups
    * Takeoffs and landings, including normal and crosswind
    * Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions
    * Climbs and climbing turns
    * Airport traffic patterns, including entry and departure procedures
    * Collision avoidance, windshear avoidance, and wake turbulence avoidance
    * Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations
    * Flight at various airspeeds from cruise to slow flight
    * Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery initiated at the first indication of a stall, and recovery from a full stall
    * Emergency procedures and equipment malfunctions
    * Ground reference maneuvers
    * Approaches to a landing area with simulated engine malfunctions
    * Slips to a landing
    * Go-arounds
* ==**Initial 90-day solo endorsement (A.6)**==
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.87(n)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87#p-61.87(n))
    * ==By the student's instructor *who gave the training*==
    * ==Specific to *the make and model to be flown in solo flight*==
    * No older than 90 days
    * Is the *initial* endorsement
    * This and the above are the minimum necessary for student pilot to do first solo flight in traffic pattern
* ==**Additional 90-day solo endorsement (A.7)**==
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.87(p)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87#p-61.87(p))
    * This says pretty much the same thing as [14 CFR &sect;61.87(n)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87#p-61.87(n)) above, but from the perspective of the requirements on the instructor
    * This is also the *recurring* 90 day endorsement that needs to get re-upped periodically
* There are more endorsements that are applicable to student pilots described below
* The above zero-to-solo endorsements are everything the student pilot needs to solo out of the airport where their training is conducted, e.g. KHEF. To fly solo from KHEF and practice landings at KHWY or KCJR, for example, that are within 25 NM, a cross-country endorsement isn't needed, but there is a separate endorsement described below.

### Student Pilot Endorsements: Cross Country

* ==**Practice landings at aiport within 25 nm (A.8)**==
  * Solo takeoffs and landings at another airport within 25 nm: [14 CFR &sect;61.93(b)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.93#p-61.93(b)(1))
    * CFI needs to train the student to, from, and at other airport and endorse the student's logbook
    * The endorsement is specific to each airport the student is authorized to solo to
* ==**Solo cross-country in make and model (A.9)**==
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.93(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.93#p-61.93(c)(1)) and [14 CFR &sect;61.93(c)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.93#p-61.93(c)(2)) specify endorsements needed for category and make and model, respectively.
  * One endorsement combines the requirements of these two sections
  * Student needs to receive training in maneuvers specified in [14 CFR &sect;61.93(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.93#p-61.93(e))
  * This applies for any flight more than 25 nm from origin airport
* ==**Solo cross-country flight planning (A.10)**==
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.93(c)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.93#p-61.93(c)(3)) requires the student's instuctor verify their preflight planning and specifies origin and destination airports, route, and airports of landing along the way.
  * This is the "day of" endorsement and is specific to a particular flight, of a particular route, on a particular day
  * This applies for any flight more than 25 nm from origin airport
* **Repeated solo cross-country flights within 50 nm (A.11)**
  * Repeated solo cross-country flights not more than 50 nm from the point of departure: [14 CFR &sect;61.93(b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.93#p-61.93(b)(2))
  * This seems like an unlikely endorsement for most people who rent from a flight school
* *Note: student pilots need to carry their logbook only on solo cross country flights*
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(i)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2017-01-03/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(i)(2))

  * [14 CFR &sect;61.105](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-E/section-61.105)
    * Describes aeronautical knowledge areas
* ==**Retaking knowledge test after failure (A.73)**==
  * Should the student fail the knowledge test, they need to get additional training and an endorsement to retake the test

### Recreational and Sport Pilot Endorsements

* Recreational and sport pilot certificates are heavily restricted compared to a private pilot certificate
* Restrictions include how far one can fly from origin airport, restricts to E and G airpsace, altitude restrictions, horsepower restrictions, passenger carrying restrictions
* While these certificates offer an easier path to a pilot certificate than a private pilot, I don't think the marginally easier training makes up for how restricted they are
* It is unlikely I will ever give this training or grant these endorsements, so they are not covered here

### Instrument Rating Endorsements

* **Aeronautical knowledge test (A.38)**
* **Flight proficiency/practical test (A.39)**
* **Received training within 2 months for practical test (A.40)**
  * Interesting, for the instrument rating A.40 combines the usual A.1 and A.2

### Commercial Pilot Endorsements

* **Aeronautical knowledge test (A.34)**
* **Review of deficiencies on knowledge test (A.2)**
* **Flight proficiency/practical test (A.35)**
* **Received training within 2 months for practical test (A.1)**
