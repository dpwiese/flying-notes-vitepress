# Collision Avoidance

This page covers *Task B. Visual Scanning and Collision Avoidance* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Environmental conditions that degrade vision

* Hypoxia
  * Without supplemental oxygen, an individual's night vision declines measurably at pressure altitudes above 4,000 feet.
* Bright lights at night
  * Airport lighting before flight
  * Flight deck lighting
  * Dark adaptation
    * Takes 30 minutes for eyes to adjust to dark conditions
* Excessive illumination can produce glare-uncontrollable squinting, watering of the eyes, and even temporary blindness.
* Light reflected off canopy, surfaces inside aircraft, clouds, water, snow, and desert terrain.
* Smoke, haze, dust, rain, and flying toward the sun can reduce the ability to see other aircraft.
* Small print and colors become unreadable unless adequate lighting is available-aeronautical charts and instruments become hard to read.

## "See and avoid" responsibilities

* **Vigilant Lookout**
  * Pilots should also keep in mind their responsibility for continuously maintaining a vigilant lookout regardless of the type of aircraft being flown.
  * Remember that most midair collision accidents and reported near midair collision (NMAC) incidents occurred during good VFR weather conditions and during the hours of daylight.
* **Preflight Planning**
  * Review all airspace, NOTAMs, Special Use Airspace, and terrain information along their route of flight during preflight planning.
  * Pilots should also note the forecasted visibility and any adverse meteorological conditions that would affect their ability to see other aircraft
    * Smoke
    * Haze
      * Haze makes objects or terrain appear to be farther away than it actually is
    * Precipitation
    * Sun angle and position
* Use correct scan technique
* 90% time eyes outside 10% inside
* Know and follow right-of-way rules

### Right-of-Way Rules

::: info NOTE
When aircraft of the same category are converging at approximately the same altitude (except head-on, or nearly so), the aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way.
:::

* See [14 CFR &sect;91.113 - Right-of-way rules: Except water operations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.113)
* ==Right of way is generally granted to the less maneuverable aircraft==
  * If the aircraft are of different categories basically the less capable aircraft has right-of-way.
* An aircraft towing or refueling another aircraft has right-of-way over all other *engine powered* aircraft.
* When two aircraft *of any category* are approaching head-on, each should move to the right.
* Each aircraft that is being overtaken has the right-of-way and each pilot of an overtaking aircraft shall alter course to the right to pass well clear.
* Aircraft, while on final approach to land or while landing, have the right-of-way over other aircraft in flight or operating on the surface.
* ==When approaching an airport to land, lower aircraft has right-of-way.==
* An aircraft in distress has the right-of-way over all other air traffic.

## Visual scanning procedure and the importance of peripheral vision

* Scanning techniques are very important in identifying objects not just at night but during the day too.
* Scan in sections about 30&#176; wide from far to near
* Scan each section up to about 2 to 3 seconds
* Overlap each scan section by about 10&#176;
* Off-center viewing
  * Type of scan that pilots can use during night flying to rely more on rods
  * Look 10&#176; above, below, or to either side of the object
  * An object viewed longer than 2 to 3 seconds will seem to disappear
* Refocus eyes outside to look for targets
  * Empty-Field Myopia
    * Induced nearsightedness
    * If there is nothing specific to focus on, eyes default to focusing at 10-30'
    * Search out and focus on distant light sources, no matter how dim, to help prevent empty field myopia.

## Aircraft blind spots and clearing procedures

* Blind spots could be due to wing (high or low) or other aircraft structure, much like a car
* Compensate for blind spots due to aircraft design and flight attitude by moving your head or maneuvering the aircraft.
* Keep a clean windshield-dirty or bug smeared windshields can greatly reduce vision.
* ATC will provide radar traffic advisories as long as their workload permits-use whenever possible.
* Pilots should:
  1. Prior to taxiing onto a runway or landing area for takeoff, scan the approach areas for possible landing traffic by maneuvering the aircraft to provide a clear view of such areas.
      * It is important that this be accomplished even though a taxi or takeoff clearance has been received.
  2. During climbs and descents in flight conditions which permit visual detection of other traffic, execute gentle banks left and right at a frequency which permits continuous visual scanning of the airspace about them.
      * Adjust pitch attitude in climb to facilitate better visibility over the cowl
      * Adjust seat position to help see over cowl
  3. Execute appropriate clearing procedures before all turns, abnormal maneuvers, or acrobatics.
  4. Execute pattern entries and departures for the runway in use appropriate to the airport configuration and information depicted.
      * See [AIM 4-3 Airport Operations](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap4_section_3.html)
  5. During training operations maintain vigilance and make clearing turns prior to practicing a maneuver.
      * Verbalize clearing procedures ("clear left, right, above, below")

## Visual cues of an impending mid-air collision

* No relative motion of another aircraft out the side window on a converging course

## Situations that create the greatest collision risk

### Greatest collision risk

* ==Clear days near navaids==
  * Maintain vigilance in the vicinity of VORs and intersections de to converging traffic.
* ==In traffic pattern==
* VORs and Class B, C, D, and E surface areas are high hazard areas where aircraft tend to cluster -- ==*exercise vigilance even when in a radar environment*==.
* Poor visual scanning increases the risk of midair collisions.

### Aircraft speed differential and collision risk

* Average person has a reaction time of 12.5 seconds
* The greater the speed differential, the less time to see and avoid
* To determine relative altitude, use the horizon as a reference point: if the aircraft is above the horizon, it is probably on a higher flight path, and if it is below the horizon, it is probably on a lower flight path.
* Any aircraft that appears to have no relative motion is likely to be on a collision course-if it shows no lateral or vertical motion, but increases in size, take evasive action.

## Division of attention inside and outside the aircraft

* Do not spend too much time "heads down" inside
* Especially with glass cockpits, iPads, etc.
* ADS-B TIS traffic data is a *supplement*, but does not replace looking outside
    * Not all aircraft even has ADS-B out
