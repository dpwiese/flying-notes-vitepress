# Go-Around

This page covers *Task N. Go-Around/Rejected Landing* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Elements of Go-Around/Rejected Landing

1. **Situations in which a go-around is necessary.**
    * Whenever a safe landing cannot be assured
    * AFH page 13-35 -- A single-engine go-around on final approach may not be possible.
    * As a practical matter in single-engine approaches, once the airplane is on final approach with landing gear and flaps extended, it is committed to land on the intended runway, on another runway, a taxiway, or grassy infield.
2. **Importance of making a prompt decision.**
3. **Importance of applying takeoff power immediately after the go-around decision is made.**
4. **Importance of establishing proper pitch attitude.**
5. **Wing flaps retraction.**
    * From AFH page 13-23
    * Retract gear and flaps in the order: flaps -- gear -- flaps
    * Retraction of flaps from full before gear is done in part to make sure plane doesn't inadvertantly settle back on the runway after flap retraction with the gear up
6. **Use of trim.**
7. **Landing gear retraction.**
8. **Proper climb speed.**
9. **Proper track and obstruction clearance.**
10. **Use of checklist.**
11. **Importance of manufacturer's recommended procedures.**

## Common Errors Related to Go-Around/Rejected Landing

1. **Failure to recognize a situation where a go-around/rejected landing is necessary.**
2. **Hazards of delaying a decision to go around.**
3. **Improper power application.**
4. **Failure to control pitch attitude.**
5. **Failure to compensate for torque effect.**
6. **Improper trim technique.**
7. **Failure to maintain recommended airspeeds.**
8. **Improper wing flaps or landing gear retraction procedure.**
9. **Failure to maintain proper track during climb-out.**
10. **Failure to remain well clear of obstructions and other traffic.**

Additional common errors are listed in [FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) [Chapter 9: Approaches and Landings](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/10_afh_ch9.pdf) on page 9-12.
