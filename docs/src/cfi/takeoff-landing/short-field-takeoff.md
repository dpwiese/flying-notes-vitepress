# Short-Field Takeoff

This page covers *Task E. Short‚ÄêField Takeoff and Maximum Performance Climb* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Purpose of and Procedures for Short-Field Takeoff and Max Performance Climb

* **Procedures before taxiing onto the runway or takeoff area to ensure runway incursion avoidance. Verify ATC clearance/no aircraft on final at non-towered airports before entering the runway, and ensure that you are on the correct takeoff runway positioning the airplane with consideration for other aircraft, surface conditions, and wind.**
* **Short-field takeoff procedures.**
  * Most important thing: know what abort plans are prior to takeoff
  * Loss of an engine doesn't guarantee climb performance, especially at high density altitudes
  * Know the climb performance of the aircraft being flown so the correct plans can be made
* **Short-field lift-off procedures.**
  * Know relevant V-speeds for the aircraft being flown
  * In particular: $V_{\text{R}}$, $V_{\text{X}}$
  * Leave gear down as long as usable runway remains
* **Initial climb attitude and airspeed ($V_{\text{X}}$) until obstacle is cleared (50 feet AGL).**
* **Proper use of checklist.**

## Common Errors Related to Short-Field Takeoff and Maximum Performance Climb

* **Improper runway incursion avoidance procedures.**
* **Improper use of controls during a short-field takeoff.**
* **Improper lift-off procedures.**
* **Improper initial climb attitude, power setting, and airspeed ($V_{\text{X}}$) to clear obstacle.**
* **Improper use of checklist.**
* Additional common errors are listed in [FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) [Chapter 6: Takeoffs and Departure Climbs](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/07_afh_ch6.pdf) on page 6-12.
