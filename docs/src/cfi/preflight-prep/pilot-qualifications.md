  * **Aeronautical knowledge areas**
  * **Flight proficiency**
    * Maneuvers the pilot should be able to perform
  * **Aeronautical experience**

* 16 years old
  * Except 14 years old for glider or balloon

### Aeronautical Experience

* No aeronautical experience required to be a student pilot

### Privileges and Limitations

* [14 CFR &sect;61.89](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.89)
* A student pilot may not act as pilot in command of an aircraft
  * That is carrying a passenger
  * That is carrying property for compensation or hire
  * For compensation or hire
  * In furtherance of a business
  * On an international flight
    * Except that a student pilot may make solo training flights from Haines, Gustavus, or Juneau, Alaska, to White Horse, Yukon, Canada, and return over the province of British Columbia;
  * With a flight or surface visibility of less than 3 statute miles during daylight hours or 5 statute miles at night
  * When the flight cannot be made with visual reference to the surface
  * In a manner contrary to any limitations placed in the pilot's logbook by an authorized instructor
  * A student pilot may not act as a required pilot flight crewmember on any aircraft for which more than one pilot is required by the type certificate of the aircraft or regulations under which the flight is conducted, except when receiving flight training from an authorized instructor on board an airship, and no person other than a required flight crewmember is carried on the aircraft
* CFI endorses the student logbook for the specific make and model for the aircraft to be flown, good for 90 days.
* With proper documentations, as mentioned above, solo PIC flight can be completed to specific destinations or areas by the student pilot.
* Can use BasicMed
* Student pilots are required to carry their logbook on solo cross-country flights

    > includes a landing at a point other than the point of departure

  * Subparagraph (ii) say that for the purposes of meeting aeronautical experience requirements for a private pilot certificate the cross-country flight must include a point of landing more than 50 nm from the point of departure
  * This seems to mean that student pilots must carry their logbook on any flight that involves a landing at a point other than the point of departure, even if such a flight cannot count towards aeronautical experience requirements for a private pilot certificate
  * *It is probably best for student pilots to just get in the habit of keeping their logbook in their flight bag so it is always with them when they fly.*

### Flying for Hire

#### Introduction

A commercial pilot's license does not mean you can just buy a plane and start charging money to fly people around.
Rather it's quite restrictive.
First, you will be considered a *carrier* if you are willing to take payment to transport people or proerty from place to place as described in [FAA-AC-120-12A Private Carriage Versus Common Carriage Of Persons or Property](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647), with a few exceptions.
The carriage of passengers may fall under *common carriage* or *private carriage*, which are discussed below, but in either case an air carrier certificate is required.

Basically, there isn't practically anything an owner of a small plane can do to charge to carry passengers.
Rather, you'll get a job with a company / operator of a plane that will need to take care of the air carrier certificate if needed.
And really the takeaway here is that if, as a commercial pilot, you are faced with an opportunity where there is any uncertainty as to whether it is legal or not, go check out 14 CFR.

#### Definitions

* **[Operate (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Operate))**
  * With respect to aircraft, means use, cause to use, or authorize to use aircraft.
* **[Operational control (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Operational%20control))**
  * With respect to a flight, means the exercise of authority over initiating, conducting, or terminating a flight.
* **[Commercial operator (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Commercial%20operator))**
  * Means a person who, for compensation or hire, engages in the carriage by aircraft in air commerce of persons or property, other than as an air carrier or foreign air carrier or under the authority of Part 375 of this title. Where it is doubtful that an operation is for "compensation or hire", the test applied is whether the carriage by air is merely incidental to the person's other business or is, in itself, a major enterprise for profit.
* **Common carriage**
  * A carrier becomes a common carrier when it "holds itself out" to the public, or to a segment of the public as willing to furnish transportation within the limits of its facilities to any person who wants it.
  * There are four elements in defining common carriage:
      1. A holding out of a willingness to
      2. Transport persons or property
      3. From place to place
      4. For compensation
  * [FAA-AC-120-12A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647)
* **Private carriage**
  * Carriage for hire which does not involve "holding out" is private carriage.
  * [FAA-AC-120-12A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647)

  * If you have a medical certificate and are taking medication or have a condition which would make you no longer meet the requirements *then you cannot fly*
  * Don't fly if you are unable to operate the aircraft in a safe manner
* Certain medical conditions are disqualifying
  * [FAA What medical conditions does the FAA consider disqualifying?](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/medical_certification/faq/response6)
* Certain medical conditions will result in being issued a medical certificate with a limitation on it
  * For example if an applicant fails to meet the color vision standard as interpreted above but is otherwise qualified, the Examiner must issue a medical certificate bearing the limitation
    * Not valid for night flying or by color signal control
  * [Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners Application Process for Medical Certification](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/general/si/)
  * [Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners Aerospace Medical Dispositions Item 52. Color Vision](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item52/amd/)
  * Another example of a limitation is for someone who is hearing impaired they would require the limitation "not valid for flight requiring the use of radio."
  * Some disabilities may require special equipment to be installed in the aircraft, such as hand controls for pilots with paraplegia.
* **Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA)**
  * A statement authorizing medical certification of, at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, applicants whose disqualifying condition is static or non-progressive.
  * May be issued Letter of Evidence (LOE) that needs to be carried along with medical
  * May involve different levels of tests (e.g. Operational Color Vision Test (OCVT), Medical Flight Test (MFT))
* If you have any concern about potential medical deficiency, good idea to get medical certificate in the early stages of flight training
  * Remember, medical (and student pilot) certificate is required to solo
  * No age limit to log dual received, so potentially could be paying for and receiving a lot of flight training before even being eligible to solo, only to later find out you can't get medical (or it has limitation)
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(h) - Logging training time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(h))

    * Per aircraft ***category***
    * e.g. airplane, helicopter
  * After instrument currency lapses there is a 6 month "grace period" during which you are not instrument current, but can still complete the above to become curent.
    * After that need to complete an IPC
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.57(d) Instrument proficiency check](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57#p-61.57(d))
  * *Note: can file IFR flight plan, but cannot accept the clearance and go IFR even if weather is VMC*
  * If instrument currency lapses, need IPC
