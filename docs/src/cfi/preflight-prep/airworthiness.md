# Airworthiness Requirements

This page covers *Task B. Airworthiness Requirements* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## General Airworthiness Requirements and Compliance for Airplanes

### Airworthiness Directives

* [14 CFR &sect;39](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-39) covers Airworthiness Directives
* Need to find all applicable ones and make sure they are complied with
* Can look up [FAA Airworthiness Directives (ADs)](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/airworthiness_directives/)
* There are third-party services that can provide and help ensure ongoing compliance with ADs by inputting information about a plane
* Airworthiness directives are issued when
  * An unsafe condition exists in the product and
  * The condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design

### Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins

* [Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins (SAIB)](https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/safety/alerts/saib)
* A Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) is an information tool that alerts, educates, and ***makes recommendations to the aviation community.***
* SAIBs contain ***non-regulatory information and guidance that does not meet the criteria for an Airworthiness Directive (AD).***

### Special Flight Permit

* [14 CFR &sect;21.197](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-21/subpart-H/section-21.197)
* A special flight permit is a Special Airworthiness Certificate authorizing operation of an aircraft that does not currently meet applicable airworthiness requirements but is safe for a specific flight.
* FAA may require an inspection first.
* The special flight permit is issued to allow the aircraft to be flown to a base where:
  * Repairs, alterations, or maintenance can be performed.
  * For delivering or exporting the aircraft.
  * For evacuating an aircraft from an area of impending danger.
  * Manufacturer flight tests.
  * Customer demonstration.
* A special flight permit may be issued to allow the operation of an overweight aircraft for flight beyond its normal range over water or land areas where adequate landing facilities or fuel is not available.
* Also referred to as a ferry permit.
* An aircraft overdue for an annual inspection may be operated under a Special Flight Permit issued by the FAA for the purpose of flying the aircraft to a location where the annual inspection can be performed.
* However, all applicable ADs that are due must be complied with before the flight.
* To get a special flight permit, contact FSDO and use FAA Form 8130-7, Special Airworthiness Certificate.
* Valid period of a special flight permit is specified on the permit
  * [14 CFR &sect;21.181(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-21/section-21.181#p-21.181(a)(2))

## Pilot-Performed Preventive Maintenance

* [14 CFR &sect;43.3(g)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-43/section-43.3#p-43.3(g))
  * Says a pilot _may perform preventive maintenance_ under certain conditions (operated under part 91).
* [14 CFR &sect;43 Appendix A(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c))
  * Gives the list of 31 items that are considered preventative maintenance.
* [14 CFR &sect;43.7](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-43/section-43.7)
  * Says the pilot can authorize the aircraft to be returned to service after preventative maintenance.
* [14 CFR &sect;43.9](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-43/section-43.9)
  * Says the pilot must put an entry in the logbook, and what that entry must contain.
* [Hochberg 2016](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2016/Hochberg_2016_Legal_Interpretation.pdf)
  * Discusses things that do not rise to the level of preventative maintenance, and therefore do not require a logbook entry be made.
    * Adding oil to the engine.
    * Cleaning the windshield.
  * Some other things are a bit less clear:
    * Adding air to tires.

    > In the case of cleaning a windshield or getting an opinion on the condition of a tire, the FAA considers these to be covered in the normal course of flight preparation and pre-flight inspection-tasks not normally considered to fall under the definitions of maintenance or preventive maintenance.

    > The subject of adding oil is often debated; however, we note that it is not an item included in part 43, appendix A, paragraph (c), which lists items the FAA considers to be preventive maintenance.

  * However, part 43 appendix A, paragraph (c) _does_ include Lubrication in [(6)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c)(6)).
    * So this seems a bit contradictory.
  * Others that seem benign but are listed in [14 CFR &sect;43 Appendix A(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c)) and therefore require a logbook entry:
    * Tightening a cowling screw. [(26)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c)(26))
    * Replacing a position light bulb. [(17)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c)(17))
    * Adding brake fluid. [(8)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c)(8))
      * As an example the Piper Archer POH says to replenish brake fluid as necessary (8.13 Brake Service).
