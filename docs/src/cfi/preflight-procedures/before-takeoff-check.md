# Before Takeoff Check

This page covers *Task F. Before Takeoff Check* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Purpose of Before Takeoff Checklist Items

1. **Positioning the airplane with consideration for other aircraft, surface conditions, and wind.**
    * Into the wind to provide better cooling
    * Clear of the taxiway hold position, and out of the way in runup area
2. **Division of attention inside and outside the cockpit.**
3. **Importance of following the checklist and responding to each checklist item.**
4. **Reasons for ensuring suitable engine temperatures and pressures for run-up and takeoff.**
5. **Method used to determine that airplane is in a safe operating condition.**
    * **Before-takeoff check**
      * The systematic POH/AFM procedure for checking the engine, controls, systems, instruments, and avionics prior to flight.
    * The preflight should have checked many but not all items that need to be checked before flight
    * Additional checks are performed during the taxi and runup
    * Vigilance should be maintained as soon as the engines are started for any indications that a problem might exist
      * Sound, instrument indication, vibration, etc. that is not normal
    * Rolling out from taxi a brake check is performed
    * While taxiing checking correct indications on attitude indicator, turn coordinator, slip-skid indicator, and compass
    * Runup checks other systems like autopilot, magnetos, vacuum system, and others
    * Magneto checks
      * Typically magnetos have the following order: Off - R - L - Both - Start
      * Checking the the R magneto first and then L is to help ensure "Both" is selected before takeoff.
      * Otherwise, if we check R second, it is easier to turn back *towards* both, but instead of getting two clicks only getting one and ending up on L.
      * Magneto check checks three things:
        1. Magneto grounding wires (p-leads) are still connected. If not connected, then there will be no drop in RPM when you select that magneto.
        2. The drop in RPM falls within the recommended limits as defined in the POH. This says the remaining mag can provide sufficient spark to keep our engine running, even if with less than full power.
        3. The differential drop between magnetos is within limits, which might clue us in to a mistimed or other mag issue we should check out before the flight.
6. **Importance of reviewing takeoff performance airspeeds, expected takeoff distances, and emergency procedures.**
    * Most of this should have been determined before getting in the plane
    * Brief takeoff and emergency procedures so they are clear and fresh before takeoff
7. **Method used for ensuring that the takeoff area or path is free of hazards.**
    * Visually check the runway and final
    * Additional checks of base and downwind are helpful especially at untowered airports
    * Be alert at untowered airports for aircraft that might not be communicating their position or intentions
8. **Method of avoiding runway incursions and ensures no conflict with traffic prior to taxiing into takeoff position.**
