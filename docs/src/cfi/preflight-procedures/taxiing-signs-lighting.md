# Taxiing, Airport Signs, and Lighting

This page covers *Task D. Taxiing, Airport Signs, and Lighting* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Elements of Safe Taxi Operations

* **Proper brake check and correct use of brakes.**
  * Brake use should be minimal
  * When turning can use differential braking to aid turn
* **Compliance with airport/taxiway surface marking, signals, and ATC clearances or instructions.**
  * Know where to find taxi diagrams, have them, make sure they are *current*, use them, brief them
  * Review airport signs and markings
  * Listen and write down ATC clearances, draw them on taxi diagram if helpful
* **How to control direction and speed.**
  * Biggest difference compared to single engine is the ability to use differential throttling to aid in turning while taxiing
* **Flight control positioning for various wind conditions.**
  * ==Position flight controls to help prevent wind gusts from lifting the plane==
  * Bugging the wind direction on the heading indicator can help the pilot position the controls correctly

* **Procedures used to avoid other aircraft and hazards.**
* **Runway incursion avoidance procedures.**
    * See CFI TSA (Technical Subject Area) section
* **Procedures for eliminating pilot distractions.**
    * ==Before engine start passengers should be briefed using the SAFETY acronym==
      * Y for "Yak" is to remind passengers of the need for a sterile cockpit during certain phases of flight and taxiing
    * ==The pilot should be fully prepared before taxiing== so they can be vigilent during taxiing and not attempt to do other things (e.g. setup FMS) until stopped
* **Use of taxi chart during taxi.**
    * Always have current taxi diagram, review it, brief taxi instructions
* **Airport, taxiway, and runway position situational awareness.**
    * Refer to CFI TSA (Technical Subject Area) document form more information
    * Aviate, navigate, communicate applies to taxiing
    * When in doubt, stop the plane and call ATC for clarification
* **Additional taxiing operations concerns at a non-towered airport.**
    * No taxi clearances are given, so need to exercise vigilance
    * Be alert at untowered airports for aircraft that might not be communicating their position or intentions
