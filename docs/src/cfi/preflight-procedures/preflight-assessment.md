# Preflight Assessment

This page covers *Task A. Preflight Assessment* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Pilot self-assessment

* ==Use the IMSAFE checklist==
  * **I** - Illness
  * **M** - Medication
  * **S** - Stress
  * **A** - Alcohol
  * **F** - Fatigue
  * **E** - Eating / Emotion

## Determining that the airplane to be used is appropriate and airworthy

* Check required inspections have been met and perform a preflight inspection

## Airplane Preflight Inspection

* **Reasons for the preflight inspection, items that should be inspected, and how defects are detected.**
  * ==The reason for the preflight inspection is determine that the aircraft is in proper condition before flying==
  * The POH/AFM provides basic guidance as to what to inspect
    * See for example the POH page below
  * The POH/AFM provides basic guidance as to how to detect defects
    * For example in the POH page below, it indicates the adjective for the static port is "unobstructed"
  * However, the POH/AFM is not at all comprehensive when it comes to describing what is and is not normal, and how to detect defects
    * Much of this information comes from other sources, including manufacturer maintenance or shop manuals, FAA documentation, guidance from an A&P, and more
    * The guidance in the POH/AFM should serve as the *floor rather than the ceiling* in terms of what to inspect -- the PIC should feel empowered to inspect above and beyond the minimum required should they so choose
    * ==When in doubt, double check==
      * It is far better to take time while on the ground to do a bit of research, make some phone calls in order to determine whether the condition of something indicates a defect, or is normal
    * ==**In the end the PIC is still responsible for determining aircraft airworthiness**==
      * [14 CFR &sect; 91.7(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.7#p-91.7(b))
  * In addition, different equipment may have been installed that requires preflight inspection that is not described in the POH/AFM

* **Importance of using the appropriate checklist.**
    * ==The use of checklists during preflight is imperative to make sure no checks are overlooked, missed, or performed incorrectly==
    * Most aircraft checklists provide guidance in addition to and beyond the minimal guidance in the POH/AFM to ensure a correct and thorough inspection consistent with manufacturer guidance
    * Often guidance in these checklists is more conservative than that specified by the manufacturer
      * For example, requiring minimum oil levels above the manufacturers minimum oil level
* **How to determine fuel and oil quantity and contamination.**
    * ==Fuel quantity must always be checked by visual inspection==
      * Make sure fuel gauges and fuel quanity set in engine management system match
      * To determine fuel quantity at levels other than full, or those marked by the manufacturer in some other way (e.g. filler neck, tab) *do not eyeball it -- get a fuel stick and measure it*
    * ==Fuel quality is best determined from the fuel sample obtained when draining the fuel sumps==
      * Check the color of the fuel to make sure it is correct, and that there is no water or particulate matter in the fuel
    * ==Oil quantity must always be checked using a visual inspection of the level indicated on the dip stick==
      * Wipe the dip stick if needed to get a clear indication
    * Oil quality is best determined by visual inspection of the oil on the dipstick

![Water in fuel](/img/water-in-fuel.jpg){width=300}

* **Detection of fuel, oil, and hydraulic leaks.**
    * ==The first thing is to know the various systems on your aircraft to know where various fluids should be present, and thus where to look for leaks==
    * Know the colors of different fluids
      * Fuel: blue
      * Oil: amber to brown to blacker with age
      * Hydraulic: red
    * Visually inspect various places where leaks may occur during preflight
      * Prop
      * Brake lines and calipers
      * Sumps
    * Perform additional checks prior to takeoff to make final determination of leaks
      * Check pressure of brakes before engine start
      * Look for oil leaking from props after cycling them during runup

* **Inspection of the oxygen system, including supply and proper operation (if applicable).**
    * N3622A used for the MEI checkride does *not* have an oxygen system
* **Inspection of the flight controls and water rudder (if applicable).**
    * Inspect to the extent practicable during the preflight inspection
    * Areas to inspect
      * Control surfaces
      * Control linkages and cables
      * Hinges and fasteners
* **Detection of visible structural damage.**
    * Planes like the Baron and many other trainers are semimonocoque construction, where the skin plays a role in the structure of the aircraft
    * Inspect the exterior of the plane for damage to the skin, rivets, and other structural components
    * Damage to the structure could lead to breakup of the aircraft during flight
* **Removal of tie-downs, control locks, and wheel chocks.**
    * While these things might be obvious, they can be easily forgotten
    * Use of checklists helps prevent this
    * Also use a final 360 degree walk-around to make a final check of important things like this that are easy to forget
      * Tiedowns removed
      * Chocks removed
      * Cowl plugs removed
      * Pitot cover removed
      * Fuel caps on
* **Removal of ice and frost.**
    * All ice and frost must be removed before flying
    * Do not assume a little bit is acceptable, as even small amount can have an adverse affect on aicraft performance
    * Remove ice and frost in a way consistent with manufacturer guidance, making sure not to damage the aircraft
    * Some common methods include
      * Brush to remove snow
      * Alcohol spray
      * Turning the aircraft to face the sun and let it melt
* **Importance of the proper loading and securing of baggage, cargo, and equipment.**
    * The two main resons for loading and securing baggage, cargo, and equipment are
      * Make sure the balance of the aircraft does not change in unintended ways during flight
      * Prevent injury to the occupants or damage to the aircraft if cargo shifts during flight
* **Use of sound judgment in determining whether the airplane is in an airworthy condition for safe flight.**
    * Follow all the guidance above
    * When in doubt do not fly
    * Gather more information if necessary to determine the aircraft is airworthy

## Environmental Factors

* Including weather, terrain, route selection, and obstructions.
