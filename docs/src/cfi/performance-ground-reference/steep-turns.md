# Steep Turns

This page covers *Task A. Steep Turns* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Elements of Steep Turns

1. **Relationship of bank angle, load factor, and stalling speed.**
    * Recall: stall is a function of angle-of-attack, and a stall can happen at any airspeed
    * Dominant physics here are the same as those in single engine
    * Relationship between bank angle and load factor is not linear
      * It varies like $\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)}$, which is what is plotted below
    * Note also how to calculate maneuvering speed at weight less than max gross
      * $V_{\text{A}}=V_{\text{A,max}}\sqrt{\frac{W_{\text{act}}}{W_{\text{max}}}}$
      * [Aviation Stackexchange: Why does maneuvering speed vary with weight?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/18912/why-does-maneuvering-speed-vary-with-weight)

2. **Overbanking tendency.**
    * In a turn, the outside wing travels at a faster airspeed than the inside wing and, as a result, it develops more lift
    * This creates an overbanking tendency that needs to be controlled by the use of opposite aileron when the desired bank angle is reached

3. **Torque effect in right and left turns.**
    * Torque effect (for planes with props that rotate clockwise from pilot's view) will tend to roll the plane to the right
    * This asymmetry may be apparent during steep turns
    * However, it's likely that other asymmetries will be more dominant, such as the following for example
      * Sight picture
      * Even throttle application
4. **Selection of a suitable altitude.**
    * ==Start at an altitude that ensures a minimum of 3,000' AGL will be maintaned throughout the entire maneuver==
      * Don't have a great reference, closest is [Commercial Pilot - Airplane Airman Certification Standards (FAA-S-ACS-7A)](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/media/commercial_airplane_acs_change_1.pdf) that specifies minimum altitudes for other maneuvers
        * The minimum is typically 1,500 AGL for any maneuvers, and where there is a difference in the minimums for multiengine they are increased to 3,000' AGL
        * Thus a minimum of 3,000' AGL seems reasonable for steep turns
      * The Baron POH, as an example, only specifies minimum 5,000' AGL for $V_{\text{MC}}$ demo, but not for any other maneuvers
    * More altitude is always good
5. **Orientation, division of attention, and planning.**
    * Use a spot on the windshield, glarshield, or compass and keep that on the horizon
    * To correct altitude deviations can use a combination of bank and pitch changes
6. **Entry and rollout procedure.**
    * Perform CHAPS
    * Select a visual reference
    * Two 360&#176; turns in opposite directions at a 50&#176; bank angle
    * Add power on roll-in followed by nose-up trim
    * Start rollout 20 degrees before target heading
7. **Coordination of flight and power controls.**
8. **Altitude, bank, and power control during the turn.**
9. **Proper recovery to straight-and-level flight.**
    * During rollout return the nose-up trim that was added on the roll-in back to where it was
    * Reduce power back to where it was on entry
    * Perform cruise checklist

## Common Errors Related to Steep Turns

1. **Improper pitch, bank, and power coordination during entry and rollout.**
2. **Uncoordinated use of flight controls.**
3. **Improper procedure in correcting altitude deviations.**
4. **Loss of orientation.**

Additional common errors are listed in [FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) [Chapter 10: Performance Maneuvers](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/11_afh_ch10.pdf) on page 10-3.
