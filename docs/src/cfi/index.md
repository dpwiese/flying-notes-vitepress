# CFI Notes

* This page contains notes I wrote and compiled during initial CFI training.
* These notes were originally organized around the PTS that was used at the time, and are still in the process of being adapted to better align to the current [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).
* This includes multi-engine material as well that was written during my MEI training.
