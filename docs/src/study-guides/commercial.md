### Task A. Pilot Qualifications

#### What new privileges does a commercial pilot certificate give?

* A commercial pilot may act as PIC of an aircraft carrying persons/property for hire or as PIC of an aircraft for hire.
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.133(a)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.133#p-61.133(a)(1))

#### Can a commercial pilot buy a plane and start charging to fly people from point A to point B?

* No.
* [14 CFR &sect;119](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-G/part-119?toc=1) applies to pilots operating or intending to operate civil aircraft as an air carrier or commercial operator, carrying persons or property for compensation or hire.

#### So specifically what operations *can* you conduct as a commercial pilot?

* [14 CFR &sect;119.1(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-119/section-119.1#p-119.1(e))
  * Flight instruction
  * Ferry or training flights
  * Aerial photography
  * Banner towing
  * Skydive operations
  * And some others
* **There are certain operations that can be done under Part 91 when common carriage is not involved**
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.501(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.501#p-91.501(b))
  * Ferry or training flights
  * Aerial photography
  * Pipeline patrol
  * Flights conducted by the operator of an airplane for personal transportation or transportation of guests if no charge is made
  * And some others
  * In addition, this section describes certain things that *can* be charged for during certain specific operations
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.501(d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.501#p-91.501(d))

#### Which of the following can you do as a commercial pilot?

* You are hired by a skydive company to fly skydivers
  * This is legal under [14 CFR &sect;91.147](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.147)
* You want to rent a plane to fly somewhere with your friends and split the rental cost and fuel equally
  * This is legal under [14 CFR &sect; 61.113(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.113#p-61.113(c))
* An aircraft owner wants to pay you to fly them somewhere in their plane
  * This is legal under [14 CFR &sect;91.501(b)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.501#p-91.501(b)(4))
* An aircraft owner wants to pay you to fly their friends and family members somehwhere in their plane
  * This is legal under [14 CFR &sect;91.501(b)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.501#p-91.501(b)(4)) as long as the aircraft owner isn't charging his friends and family for the flight

####  What is common carriage?

* There are four elements in defining common carriage:
    1. A holding out of a willingness to
    2. Transport persons or property
    3. From place to place
    4. For compensation
* [FAA-AC-120-12A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647)

#### What is a commercial operator?

* [Commercial operator (14 CFR &sect;1.1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1(Commercial%20operator))

  > means a person who, for compensation or hire, engages in the carriage by aircraft in air commerce of persons or property, other than as an air carrier or foreign air carrier or under the authority of Part 375 of this title. Where it is doubtful that an operation is for “compensation or hire”, the test applied is whether the carriage by air is merely incidental to the person's other business or is, in itself, a major enterprise for profit.

#### Is a private carrier exempt from getting an air carrier certificate?

* No.
* [14 CFR &sect;119.23](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-G/part-119#119.23)

#### What are SIGMETs and AIRMETs?

* **AIRMET (WA)**:
  * Stands for Airmen's Meteorological Information
  * Less intense than requiring a SIGMET, used in preflight to enhance flight safety.
  * ==Forecasts valid for 6 hours==
  * Issued every 6 hours, as well as unscheduled updates.
  * Include info about IFR, extensive mountain obscuration, turbulence, strong surface winds, icing, freezing levels.
  * *Of operational interest to all aircraft*, ==*potentially hazardous to light aircraft*==
    * Pilots of heavy aircraft aren't really going to worry about AIRMETs
  * Types
    * **Sierra**: describes IFR conditions and/or extensive mountain obscurations
    * **Tango**: Turbulence, sustained surface winds more than 30kts, low level wind shear
    * **Zulu**: Moderate icing and freezing level heights
  * Includes forecast of moderate icing, moderate turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30 knots or greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,000 feet and/or visibilities less than three miles, and extensive mountain obscurement.
  * [https://www.aviationweather.gov/sigmet/help](https://www.aviationweather.gov/sigmet/help)
    * The definition here is a bit different than in PHAK, for example
* **SIGMET (WS)**
  * Significant Meteorological Information [AIM 7-1-6 Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-6)
  * *Weather that is potentially hazardous to all aircraft*
  * ==Forecasts valid for 4 hours==
  * Types
    * Severe icing
    * Severe turbulence / clear air turbulence (CAT)
    * IMC due to sandstorms, volcanic ash
* **Convective SIGMET (WST)**
  * Advises of significant weather due to thunderstorms
  * Severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, low-level wind shear
  * ==*Hazardous to all categories of aircraft*==
  * Issued hourly at H+55
  * ==Forecasts valid for 2 hours==
  * ==Conditions to issue Convective SIGMET==
    * ==Severe thunderstorms due to 50 kts or greater surface winds or hail more than 3/4" in diameter==
    * ==Tornadoes==
    * ==A line of thunderstorms 60+ nm long==
    * ==Severe or embedded thunderstorms for 30+ minutes==
    * ==Area of thunderstorms covering at least 40% of the area concerned== and exhibiting a very strong radar reflectivity or a significant satellite or lightning signature.
* Look up [AIRMETs/SIGMETs](https://www.aviationweather.gov/sigmet) online
* See also [Graphical AIRMETs](https://www.aviationweather.gov/gairmet)

#### Winds and Temperatures Aloft

* What are the altitudes given? MSL or AGL?
* Why are some entries blank?
* Decode some entries.

##### Textual

* Winds and Temperatures Aloft Forecast - Textual (FD)
* See also the graphical version Winds and Temperatures Aloft Forecast - Graphical (FB)
* See Aviation Weather Center's [Winds/Temps Data](https://aviationweather.gov/data/windtemp/)
* Winds and temps aloft are *forecasts* based on observations made a few hours prior
* Made twice a day based on the radiosonde upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z
* Format `DDSSTT` where
  * `D` is wind direction
  * `S` is wind speed
  * `T` is temperature
* Example `2321-04` is wind from 230 at 21 knots and temperature -21 &#176;C
* No winds given below 1,000 ft AGL
  * [NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-812](https://www.weather.gov/media/directives/010_pdfs/pd01008012curr.pdf)
* No temp is given for 3,000 ft MSL or when 2,500 ft AGL
* ==Above 24,000 feet all temperatures are negative so minus sign is dropped==
* Wind `9900` means light and variable (less than 5 kts)
* For winds greater than 99 knots, add `50` to the `DD` and subtract 100 from the wind speed to get `SS` values
  * Example: `7545` means winds of 145 knots from 250

### Airspace

#### Describe where the following airspaces can be found. Reference a VFR sectional.

##### Class E

* [AIM 3-2-6](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-6)
* Any controlled airspace that is not A-D
* Class E airspace below 14,500 feet MSL is charted on Sectional, Terminal, and IFR Enroute Low Altitude charts.
* *So technically the default is G up to 14,500 unless otherwise charted*
* ==However, with very few exceptions (see class G airspace below) class E is charted to start at either 700' or 1200' AGL==
  * ==So basically the default is that E starts at 1200' AGL except where charted to start at 700' AGL, or where shown to *not* to start at 1200' AGL.==
  * This can be seen along the US border, where it shows the start of E at 1,200'
* 700/1200 ft AGL – 18,000 ft MSL (A), up to 12 nm off US coast
* "1200 ft, except where the elephant steps"
* VFR chart Colors
  * To surface: dashed magenta
  * 700 ft floor: ombre magenta
  * 1200 ft floor: ombre blue
    * Note: ombre is a French word meaning shaded, where one hue blends to another
* Weather, Aircraft, Pilot Requirements

##### Class G

* [AIM 3-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_3.html)
* SFC – Base of class E
* Even though there is no ATC, still minimum requirements to comply with FAA
* In certain designated areas class G extends up to 14,500 feet
  * This is on VFR charts, but easier to see on IFR charts

#### VFR Weather Minimums

![VFR weather minimums. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 15: Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/17_phak_ch15.pdf) Figure 15-8](/img/vfr-weather-minimums.png){width=800}

## Systems

* TBD

## Emergency Procedures

### Engine Failure

#### What is the glide ratio of your plane?

* Piper Archer III NXi: approximately 1.88 nm per 1000 feet
* Equivalently: approximately 11.4:1
  * So 1000 feet AGL will give a glide range of 11,400 or approximately 1.9 nm
* This is without wind

## Unsorted

### Aeromedical Factors

#### What is hypoxia?

* See [Human Factors](/cfi/tsa/human-factors)
