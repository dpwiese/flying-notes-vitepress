# Instrument Proficiency Check

## Introduction

* This document follows the FAA [Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC) Guidance](https://www.faasafety.gov/files/events/EA/EA03/2018/EA0382492/IPC_Guidance.pdf) from March 2010
* **==Instrument currency is maintained by accomplishing the following in last 6 calendar months (66 HIT)==**
  * ==Within preceding **6 calendar months**==
    * ==**6** - 6 instrument approaches==
    * ==**H** - Holding procedures and tasks==
    * ==**I** - Intercepting and==
    * ==**T** - Tracking courses through the use of navigational electronic systems==
  * [14 CFR 61.57(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57#p-61.57(c))
  * Per aircraft ***category***
    * e.g. Airplane, rotorcraft
* After instrument currency lapses, there is a six-month "grace period" where a pilot can regain their instrument currency
  * After this six-month "grace period" an IPC is required
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.57(d)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.57#p-61.57(d)(1))
* [FAA-AC-61-98E Currency Requirements and Guidance for the Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_61-98E.pdf)
  * Gives a list of areas to cover during an IPC
* [FAA-S-ACS-8B Instrument Rating Airplane Airman Certification Standards Change 1](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_acs_change_1.pdf)
  * Provides the areas of operation to cover during an IPC
* [FAA-AC-61-65H Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1034129)
  * Gives the required endorsement upon satisfactory completion of an IPC
  * No logbook entry reflecting unsatisfactory performance is required
  * Just log it as dual given

### Weather Briefing

* How to obtain a weather briefing
* Weather products availabe
* How to use briefing as part of good ADM

### Performance Calculations

* Be able to use POH to determine aircraft performance given the forecast conditions
* Use calculated performance in ADM

<!--@include: ./docs/src/includes/ifr-alternates.md | shift:3-->

### Risk Management and Personal Minimums

* Perceives risk from the four fundamental risk elements or categories (**PAVE**)
  * **P** ilot
  * **A** ircraft
  * en **V** ironment
  * **E** xternal pressures (mission)
* See personal minimums worksheet

## Taxi, Takeoff and Departure

### Taxi Procedures and Runway Incursion Avoidance

* See [Runway Incursion Avoidance](/cfi/tsa/runway-incursions)

## En Route

<!--@include: ./docs/src/includes/waypoints.md | shift:2-->

### En Route Weather

* **Onboard Weather Radar**
  * Most up-to-date weather information available
  * May be used for "tactical" weather avoidance
  * Good supplement to existing weather sources
  * Has limitations like blind splot where distance stuff can be blocked by near stuff
* **XM lightning**
  * Lightning strikes sensed by ground stations
  * Lightning can't hide from ground stations
  * Broadcast to plane via satellite
* **NEXRAD**
  * Ground-based radar information broadcast to planes via satellite
  * Information may be 15 minutes or more old
  * NEXRAD and ADS-B weather both come from NWS
* **ADS-B**
  * Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B)
  * Information sent directly to planes from ground stations
  * Usually no more than 5 minutes old
* **Flight service**
  * Nationwide on 122.2
  * Available over most VORs
* **Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS)**
  * Continuous broadcast service over selected VORs of Inflight Weather Advisories; i.e. SIGMETs, CONVECTIVE SIGMETs, AIRMETs, Severe Weather Forecast Alerts (AWWs), and Center Weather Advisories (CWAs).
  * Discontinued in 2020
