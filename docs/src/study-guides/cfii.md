## Preflight Preparation

### I.A. Pilot Qualifications

*Scenario: You are taking 2 friends, Joe and Colin up to the Allegheny County Airport today to visit other friends. Many of the questions involve your preparation for that flight. The weather at your departure airport at your your time of departure is winds 340@14, 800' overcast, temp +5 &#176;C. Weather at `AGC` is winds 300@12, 400' overcast, temp +8 &#176;C*

* **Could you legally fly this flight as a private pilot without an instrument rating?**
  * ==No, we can not climb into the clouds on departure, or descend through them to land at AGC==
  * See chart below for VFR weather minimums
  * We'd plan this flight using the Arsenal 5 departure Linden transition `ARSNL5.LDN` then direct
    * This was overwhelmingly the most used IFR route for this departure/destination pair on the ForeFlight route planner

![VFR weather minimums. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 15: Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/17_phak_ch15.pdf) Figure 15-8](/img/vfr-weather-minimums.png){width=800}

* **What other privileges do you have as an instrument pilot vs. a private pilot alone?**
  * **==Flight under IFR or in weather less than VFR in controlled airspace==**
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e) Instrument rating](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e))
      * *"No person may act as pilot in command of a civil aircraft under IFR or in weather conditions less than the minimums prescribed for VFR flight unless that person holds ... instrument rating on that person's pilot certificate."*
    * Really this is flight in weather less than VMC in *any* airspace, as operations in uncontrolled airspace under IMC without a clearance or instrument rating violate [14 CFR &sect;91.13 Careless or reckless operation](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-A/section-91.13)
  * **==Flight in Class A airspace==**
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.135 Operations in Class A airspace](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.135)
      * *"Each person operating an aircraft in Class A airspace must conduct that operation under instrument flight rules (IFR)."*
  * **==Passengers for hire on cross countries longer than 50 nm or at night==**
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.133 Commercial pilot privileges and limitations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-F/section-61.133)
      * *"The carriage of passengers for hire in airplanes on cross-country flights in excess of 50 nautical miles* ***or*** *at night is prohibited."*
  * **==Special VFR at night==**
    * Technically it is between sunset and sunrise
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.157(b)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.157#p-91.157(b)(4))
      * *"The person being granted the ATC clearance meets the applicable requirements for* ***instrument flight*** *under part 61 of this chapter."*
* **Additional currency requirements by adding an instrument rating?**
  * ==Use **66 HIT** to remember instrument currency requirements==
    * **==6 Approaches==** within
    * **==6 months==** including
    * **==Holding==**
      * Procedures and tasks
    * **==Intercepting==**
    * **==Tracking==**
      * Courses through the use of navigational electronic systems
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.57(c) Instrument experience](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57#p-61.57(c))
    * Per aircraft ***category***
    * e.g. airplane, helicopter
  * After instrument currency lapses there is a 6 month "grace period" during which you are not instrument current, but can still complete the above to become curent.
    * After that need to complete an IPC
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.57(d) Instrument proficiency check](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57#p-61.57(d))
* **Logging requirements?**
  * ==Log the requirements of 66 HIT==
    * ==Approaches==
      * ==Location==
      * ==Type==
    * ==Holds==
    * ==Name of the safety pilot if used==
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51 Pilot logbooks](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51)
    * *"Each person must document and record ... the aeronautical experience required for meeting the recent flight experience requirements of this part."*
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(g) Logging instrument time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(g))
    * *"A person may log instrument time only for that flight time when the person operates the aircraft solely by reference to instruments under actual or simulated instrument flight conditions."*
    * *"For the purposes of logging instrument time to meet the recent instrument experience requirements of &sect;61.57(c) of this part, the following information must be recorded in the person's logbook - (i) The location and type of each instrument approach accomplished; and (ii) The name of the safety pilot, if required."*
* **What endorsements can you give as a CFII that you cannot as a CFI?**
  * Instrument knowledge test
    * Including review of deficiencies
    * Retest endoresment
  * Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC)
  * Endorse for practical test
* **Safety pilot logging?**
  * See above
  * ==Log the name of safety pilot==
  * Be in agreement ahead of time who is acting PIC
    * If the safety pilot is acting as the PIC and the pilot under the foggles is the sole manipulator of the flight controls, both can *log PIC*
* **Special emphasis areas**
  * **Runway Incursion**
    * See [Runway Incursion Avoidance](/cfi/tsa/runway-incursions)
  * **Hot Spots**

    * ==Valid for a 24 or 30-hour time period==
    * Updated four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z
      * 30 hour TAFs are usually at airports that serve long-range aircraft, so they can get their TAFs more in advance before taking off
  * Some common terms and descriptors
    * `NSW`
      * No significant weather
    * `SKC`
      * Sky clear
    * `TEMPO`
      * ==Last for *less than an hour* and *occur during less than half of the time period specified*==
    * `AUTO`
      * When METAR countains `AUTO` it means there was no human intervention to augment the report with information like thunderstorms in vicinity
    * `$`
      * At the end of METAR `$` indicates system that generated it may be in need of maintenance
    * `AO1`
      * ==Thinks any precipitation is rain==
    * `AO2`
      * ==Can tell the difference between types of precipitation==
    * `PRESRR`

  * Remarks
    * `RAE19`
      * Rain ended 19 minutes past the hour
    * `SLP978`
      * Sea Level Pressure in mbar
      * To get Sea Level Pressure need to prepend a `9` or `10`, to get a value that is closest to 1000 mbar
      * In this case we prepend `9` to get `9978` or 997.8 mbar
      * If we prepended a `10` the value would be too large
    * `P0001`
      * Hourly precipitation in hundredths of an inch (0.01 inches) since last METAR
    * `T00670061`
      * ==Hourly temperature 6.7 &#176;C and dewpoint 6.1 &#176;C==
      * The leading `0` of each four digit group indicates the values are positive, a leading `1` indicates the values are negative

  * `PRESFR`
    * Pressure falling rapidly
    * ==When pressure is rising or falling rapidly it means winds will be strong==

* **Winds aloft, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, convective sigmets, CB avoidance**
  * **Winds Aloft**
    * ==Winds and temps aloft are *forecasts* based on observations made a few hours prior==
    * Made twice a day based on the radiosonde upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z
    * Format `DDSSTT` where
      * `D` is wind direction
      * `S` is wind speed
      * `T` is temperature
    * Example `2321-04` is wind from 230 at 21 knots and temperature -21 &#176;C
    * ==No temp is given for 3,000 ft MSL or when 2,500 ft AGL==
    * ==Above 24,000 feet all temperatures are negative so minus sign is dropped==
    * Wind `9900` means light and variable (less than 5 kts)
    * For winds greater than 99 knots, subtract `50` from the `DD` group and add 100 to the `SS` group to get actual wind speed and direction
      * Example: `7545` means winds of 145 knots from 250
    * See also the graphical version Winds and Temperatures Aloft (FB)
    * See Aviation Weather Center's [Winds/Temps Data](https://aviationweather.gov/windtemp)
  * **AIRMET (WA)**
    * Stands for Airmen's Meteorological Information
    * ==*Of operational interest to all aircraft*==
    * ==*Potentially hazardous to light aircraft*==
      * Pilots of heavy aircraft aren't really going to worry about AIRMETs
    * ==Forecasts valid for 6 hours==
    * Issued every 6 hours, as well as unscheduled updates
    * **==3 Types==**
      * **Sierra**: describes IFR conditions and/or extensive mountain obscurations, widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,000 feet and/or visibilities less than three miles
      * **Tango**: moderate turbulence, sustained surface winds 30kts or greater, low level wind shear
      * **Zulu**: moderate icing and freezing level heights
    * Less intense than requiring a SIGMET, used in preflight to enhance flight safety
    * [https://www.aviationweather.gov/sigmet/help](https://www.aviationweather.gov/sigmet/help)
      * The definition here is a bit different than in PHAK, for example
  * **SIGMET (WS)**
    * Stands for Significant Meteorological Information
    * ==*Potentially hazardous to all categories of aircraft*==
    * ==Forecasts valid for 4 hours==
    * Types
      * Severe icing not associated with thunderstorms
      * Severe turbulence / clear air turbulence (CAT) not associated with thunderstorms
      * IMC due to sandstorms, volcanic ash
    * Significant Meteorological Information [AIM 7-1-6 Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-6)
  * **Convective SIGMET (WST)**
    * Advises of significant weather due to thunderstorms
    * Severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, low-level wind shear
    * ==*Hazardous to all categories of aircraft*==
    * Issued hourly at H+55
    * ==Forecasts valid for 2 hours==
    * ==Conditions to issue Convective SIGMET==
      * ==Severe thunderstorms due to 50 kts or greater surface winds or hail more than 3/4" in diameter==
      * ==Tornadoes==
      * ==A line of thunderstorms 60+ nm long==
      * ==Severe or embedded thunderstorms for 30+ minutes==
      * ==Area of thunderstorms covering at least 40% of the area concerned== and exhibiting a very strong radar reflectivity or a significant satellite or lightning signature.
  * **CB Avoidance**
    * Use all weather products available to determine likelihood of convective activity along route of flight
    * Use onboard and other resources available during flight to get updated information during flight
    * Avoid thunderstorms by at least 20 nm
    * Exercise good ADM to avoid convective activity

### I.C. Cross Country Flight Planning

* **Cross country flight planning to AGC. Chart symbols**
  * See [FAA Aeronautical Chart Users' Guide](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/aero_guide/)
    * Seems to now be a single guide for all charts
  * IFR low chart symbols
    * [IFR Enroute Aeronautical Charts and Planning](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/ifr/)
    * **Green** or **Blue** have an IAP or radar minima
      * Blue airports have high approaches, ones that start at around 18,000' MSL
    * **Brown** airports *do not* have an IAP or radar minima
    * Radar minima means there are published minima for ASR or PAR approach
    * Compulsory reporting points are *solid*
    * Navaids list Service Volumes (SSV) for VOR, DME, and TACAN separately
      * For example for the Casanova VORTAC, `CSN (H) (H)` means VOR `(H)` and TACAN `(H)` service volumes
      * [AIM 1-1-8 NAVAID Service Volumes](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_1.html#ncG212JACK)
    * Some VOR/VORTAC/TACAN on IFR low charts do not have a compass rose
      * This does *not* mean they are terminal VORs
      * Rather they may not have victor airways associated with them, or the compass rose may have been omitted for clarity
      * See `LFI`, `DOV`, `ADW`, and `DEN` as some examples
    * Airways that look like victor airways but that start with different letters are typically oceanic airways
    * Military Training Routes (MTR)
      * Denoted by `IR` or `VR`
      * 3 digits if above 1,500' AGL, 4 digits if below

#### DME Distance Arrows on Low Enroute Chart

![Consider SCAPE intersection. The segment between SCAPE and HGR is 21 nm. However, due to the absence of the DME arrow between HGR and SCAPE, 21 DME from HGR cannot be used to identify SCAPE. The DME arrow does not include the distance with the arrow when the distance value is "obvious" - for the first segment where no addition or rounding is required to determine DME to a fix which is multiple segments from a VOR. Note: some features have been omitted from the chart for clarity.](/img/scape-decluttered.jpg){width=600}

#### More Cross Country Flight Planning

* **Alternates**
  * Do we need to file an alternate?
    * If filing IFR to an airport without an instrument approach, you must have an alternate no matter what
    * Otherwise apply the 1-2-3 rule
  * If we *do* need an alternate, can I use a particular airport as my alternate?
    * This depends on the weather *at the ETA*
    * Check the TERPs for that airports alternate minimums
    * Otherwise use "standard" alternate minimums of 600-2 and 800-2
    * Also in TERPS check for "NA when local weather not available." - if the weather reporting equipment at the alternate is out as reported by NOTAM then the airport *cannot* be used as an alternate
* **Airpsace**
  * Mode-C and ADS-B required in
    * Class A, B, and C airspace
    * Class E airspace at or above 10,000' MSL (excluding airspace at and below 2,500' AGL)
    * Mode-C veil (30 nm) up to 10,000' MSL
    * Above Class C airspace up to 10,000' MSL
    * Class E airspace over the Gulf of Mexico, at and above 3,000' MSL, within 12 nm of the U.S. coast
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.225 - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment and use](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.225)

* **What required ATC reports and calls are specific to instrument flights?**
  * ==Required reports (**MARVELOUS VFR C500**)==
    * ==**M** - Missed approach==
    * ==**A** - Airspeed==
      * +/- 10 kts or 5% of filed TAS (whichever greater)
      * ATC basically wants to know if we are making a deliberate power change
    * ==**R** - Reaching a holding fix==
      * Time and altitude
      * Crossing the holding fix outbound as part of our entry procedure
    * ==**V** - VFR on-top altitude changes==
    * ==**E** - ETA change==
      * Of more than +/- 2 minutes
      * *In non-radar environment*
    * ==**L** - Leaving a holding fix==
    * ==**O** - Outer marker inbound==
      * *In non-radar environment*
      * Outer marker indicates final approach fix for non-precision approach
    * ==**U** - Unforecast weather==
      * Especially icing, turbulence, wind
    * ==**S** - Safety of flight==
    * ==**V** - Vacating an altitude or flight level==
    * ==**F** - FAF inbound==
      * *In non-radar environment*
    * ==**R** - Radio or navigation failure==
    * ==**C** - Compulsory reporting points==
      * *In non-radar environment*
      * This includes points which define the route of flight
    * ==**500** - Failure to maintain at least 500 FPM climb or descent==
  * ==How to report one of the above (**PTA PT P**)==
    * **P** - Point
    * **T** - Time
    * **A** - Altitude
    * **P** - Point
    * **T** - Time
    * **P** - Point
    * For example
      * *=="Potomac Approach, Skyventures 124 is over CSN at 4000 feet 30 minutes after the hour, expect BRV at 45 minutes after the hour, then FAK"==*
    * *Note: in the above example, the use of time in reference to minutes before or after the hour avoids confusion across time zone. Otherwise, use Zulu time instead of local time to similarly avoid confusion.*
* **Loss of radar coverage reports**
  * *For the scenario in this question, consider a flight to the Bahamas some time after a hurricane had passed through disabling secondary radar coverage, thus requiring pilots to make position reports on their flight.*
    * See [FAA VFR Raster Charts](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr/) [Carribean - 1](https://aeronav.faa.gov/visual/11-03-2022/PDFs/Caribbean_1_VFR.pdf) chart
  * ==See required reports (**MARVELOUSVFRC500**) and how to report (**PTA PT P**) above==
  * Recap of the ones specific to non-radar environment
    * ==**E** - ETA change==
      * Of more than +/- 2 minutes
    * ==**O** - Outer marker inbound==
    * ==**F** - FAF inbound==
    * ==**C** - Compulsory reporting points==
      * This includes points which define the route of flight
  * Applying (**PTA PT P**) to a call we might make on the Bahamas chart
    * *=="Miami Center, Skyventures 124 is over BIMINI at 4000 feet 15 minutes after the hour, expect CAREY at 45 minutes after the hour, then NASSAU"==*
  * *Note: in the above example, the use of time in reference to minutes before or after the hour avoids confusion across time zone. Otherwise, use Zulu time instead of local time to similarly avoid confusion.*

## Emergency Operations

### VII.A Loss of Communications Procedures

* **Loss of communications procedures**
  * ==If the radio fails while VFR, fly VFR and land as soon as practicable==
    * If you enter VMC try to stay in VMC
  * ==If flight needs to be continued IFR after losing communications, the following *route* should be flown (**AVEF**)==
    * ==**A** - Assigned==
      * In last ATC clearance
    * ==**V** - Vectored==
    * ==**E** - Expected==
      * From last ATC communication
    * ==**F** - Filed==
      * In flight plan
  * ==If flight needs to be continued IFR after losing communications, the **highest** of the following *altitude* should be flown (**MEA**) *for each route segment*==
    * ==**M** - Minimum altitude for IFR operations==
    * ==**E** - Expected==
      * From last ATC communication
    * ==**A** - Assigned==
      * In last ATC clearance
  * If radio failure happens and clearance limit **is** the fix from which approach begins
