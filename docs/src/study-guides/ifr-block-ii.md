## Airworthiness and Qualification Requirements Related to IFR Operations

### Ensure applicant is proficient in IFR Pilot Qualifications and Currency

#### What are some of the aeronautical experience requirements and qualifications you need to get your instrument rating?

* [Aeronautical Experience](/cfii/tsa/regulations-publications#aeronautical-experience)

#### What new privileges will an instrument rating give you?

* [Privileges and Limitations](/cfii/tsa/regulations-publications#privileges-and-limitations)

#### As an instrument rated pilot, what are you required to do to maintain currency?

* [Instrument Currency Requirements](/cfii/tsa/regulations-publications#instrument-currency-requirements)

#### What are the rules for using a safety pilot?

* Current medical certificate
* Occupy the other control seat
* Be appropriately rated in the category and class aircraft flown [&sect;61.3(c), &sect;61.51, &sect;61.57(c) and &sect;91.109].
* The pilot operating under simulated instrument conditions must also log the name of the safety pilot.

#### What about logging when using a safety pilot?

* Both pilots may log PIC time _if the safety pilot is the acting pilot in command_.
  * 14 CFR &sect;61.51(e) allows both the sole manipulator of the controls and the acting PIC to log PIC time, because it's an operation that requires both pilots.
* If the safety pilot is _not the acting pilot in command_ then the _cannot_ log PIC time.

#### Can both you and the safety pilot log PIC time in actual IMC?

* No, a safety pilot is not required in actual IMC.

#### Does safety pilot need complex or high performance endorsements, if you are using a safety pilot in such a plane?

* No, category and class only with current medical.
* But, per [14 CFR &sect;61.31](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.31) the safety pilot cannot _act as PIC_ without these endorsements.

#### Under what conditions can you legally log an approach?

* Solely by reference to instruments (simulated or actual instrument conditions)
* Established on each required segment of the IAP down to minimums
* When simulating IMC, simulated IMC must exist down to minimums
* In actual IMC, actual IMC must exist at least to the FAF
* Do not need to fly the missed

#### What do you do if your instrument currency lapses?

* IPC.

#### When you get your multi-engine rating, will you need to do IFR currency in both single and multi?

* No.
* Currency is per aircraft _category_ e.g. Airplane, rotorcraft
* [14 CFR 61.57(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57#p-61.57(c))

### 91.205 IFR Equip.

#### What equipment is required for IFR?

* [IFR Required Equipment](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#ifr-required-equipment)

### Required Inspections for IFR Operations

* [Inspections Required](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#inspections-required)
* VOR 30 days
* Altimeter/static system - 24 calendar months

### VOR Receiver Accuracy Check

* [VOR Check](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#vor-check)

#### What are the different methods to check, and what are the tolerances for the check to "pass"?

* VOT: +/- 4 deg
* Ground checkpoint: +/- 4 deg
* Airborne checkpoint: +/- 6 deg
* Dual check: within 4 deg

#### Where can I find the nearest VOT or checkpoint?

* Chart Supplement.

#### How do I use a VOT?

* 180 with `TO` indication

#### What do we need to log when having done a VOR check?

* PADS
  * Place
  * Accuracy
  * Date
  * Signature

## Cross Country Flight Planning (IFR)

### Route planning, including consideration of the available navigational facilities, special use airspace, preferred routes, and alternate airports.

#### Where do you go to find preferred routes?

* Chart Supplement.

#### What are some considerations when selecting your route?

* [IFR Routing](/cfii/preflight-prep/xc-planning#ifr-routing)

#### When is an alternate required?

* [Alternates Under IFR](/cfii/preflight-prep/xc-planning#alternates-under-ifr)
* 123 rule: [14 CFR &sect;91.169(b)(2)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.169#p-91.169(b)(2)(i))

#### If my planned destination does not have an IAP, is an alternate required?

* Yes.

#### Even if the forecast weather at my destination is totally clear?

* Yes.
* There is an "and" in the conditions of [14 CFR &sect;91.169(b)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.169#p-91.169(b)(1))

#### So saw I need an alternate. Are there any restrictions on whether I can use an airport as my alternate?

* [14 CFR &sect;91.169(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.169#p-91.169(c))
* Check weather at ETA at alternate
  * Whatever is specified as the alternate minimums for that IAP
  * If no alternate minimums are specificed:
    * Precision approach: 600 ft ceilings, 2 sm visibility
    * Non-precision approach: 800 ft ceilings, 2 sm visibility
  * Or if there is no IAP, then weather good enough to allow descent from MEA, approach, and landing under VFR.

#### Can I use an airport as an alternate that has only a GPS approach?

* Only if your plane has WAAS.
* [AIM 1-2-3(d) Alternate Airport Considerations](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap1_section_2.html#$paragraph1-2-3):

> For the purposes of flight planning, any required alternate airport must have an available instrument approach procedure that does not require the use of GPS.
> This restriction does not apply to RNAV systems using TSO-C145/-C146 WAAS equipment.

#### Are there any minimums required to fly an IAP?

* Not part 91.

#### Are there any departure minimums?

* [Takeoff Minimums](http://localhost:5173/cfii/tsa/regulations-publications#takeoff-minimums)
* Not part 91.

### Altitude selection accounting for terrain and obstacles, glide distance of airplane, IFR cruising altitudes, effect of wind, and oxygen requirements.

#### What are the following IFR altitude terms?

* [IFR Altitudes](/cfii/tsa/regulations-publications#ifr-altitudes)

### Calculating: Time, climb and descent rates, course, distance, heading, true airspeed, and groundspeed

* TBD

### Calculating: Estimated time of arrival to include conversion to universal coordinated time(UTC)

* TBD

### Calculating: Fuel requirements, to include reserve Elements of an IFR flight plan.

* TBD

#### What are our fuel requirements when flying IFR?

* [IFR Fuel Requirements](/cfii/preflight-prep/xc-planning#ifr-fuel-requirements)

### Procedures for activating and closing an IFR flight plan in controlled and uncontrolled airspace.

#### When do you need to file an IFR flight plan?

* Flight in IMC in controlled airspace.

#### How long are IFR flight plans "good for"?

* 30 minutes before departure time, 2 hours after.

#### If you land at a towered airport do you need to close your flight plan?

* No.
* Tower will close it.

#### What about a non-towered airport?

* We need to call and close.
* ATC or FSS.

### Present fight plan assigned by the evaluator including a risk analysis based on real time weather which includes calculating time en route and fuel considering factors such as power settings, operating altitude, wind, fuel reserve requirements, and weight and balance requirements.

* TBD

#### Do we need to go to our filed alternate?

* No.

### Recalculate fuel reserves based on a scenario provided by the evaluator.

* TBD

### Simulate filing an IFR flight plan.

* TBD

### Interpret departure, arrival, en route, and approach procedures with reference to appropriate and current charts.

* TBD

### Recognize simulated wing contamination due to airframe icing and demonstrate knowledge of the adverse effects of airframe icing during pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise, and landing phases of flight as well as the corrective actions.

* TBD
* [Deicing and Anti-icing](/cfii/preflight-prep/xc-planning#deicing-and-anti-icing)

### Apply pertinent information from appropriate and current aeronautical charts, Charts Supplement; NOTAMs relative to airport, runway and taxiway closures; and other flight publications.

#### Emergency scenario: loss of comm

* [Communication Failure Under IFR](/study-guides/cfii#communication-failure-under-ifr)

#### Known Icing

* https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2007-04-03/pdf/07-1620.pdf

> The NTSB has held that known icing conditions exist when a pilot knows or reasonably should know of weather reports in which icing conditions are reported or forecast.
