## Fundamentals of Instruction

### I.A. Human Behavior and Effective Communication

* **What is Human Behavior? Why is important to instructors?**
    * ==**Human behavior** - product of factors that cause people to act in predictable ways.==
        * ==**And is the the result of attempts to satisfy certain needs**==
    * By observing human behavior, an instructor can gain the knowledge needed to better understand him or herself as an instructor as well as the learning needs of learners.
    * ==Understanding human behavior leads to successful instruction.==
        * Understand
            * Motivation for flying
            * Fatigue / anxiety in personal life
            * What learning style works best
            * Communication style
* **Your student began his training very well, but recently seemed very distracted. You find out that his wife's medical treatments are not progressing well and are stretching the budget. What might you suggest?**
    * Such deep and prolonged stress is going to cause chronic fatigue, and impair the student's ability to learn, and compromise safety.
    * Given this, the student should focus on his family's health and making sure their financial needs are met before returning to flight instruction.
* **What are 3 defense mechanisms you might see from a student?**
    * **DR CPR DR F**
    * **Denial**
        * Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening
        * A form of repression
        * Ignores the problem
        * =="My landings are fine, landing half way down the runway is no big deal."==
    * **Repression**
        * When a person places uncomfortable thoughts into inaccessible areas of the unconscious mind.
        * For example, after the CFI recovers the airplane from an inadvertent spin, the student might not be able to recall any memory of the event.
    * **Compensation**
        * Psychologically counterbalancing perceived weaknesses by emphasizing strength in other areas
        * =="Maybe I was off course, but I held altitude like a pro and you know it!"==
    * **Projection**
        * Relegating blame for personal shortcomings, mistakes, and transgressions to others
        * =="My landing was bad because my instructor had me land on a runway I've never landed on before"==
    * **Reaction Formation**
        * Faking of a belief opposite to the true belief because the true belief causes anxiety
        * =="I don't care what people think of me..."== when really they are lonely and long for acceptance.
    * **Displacement**
        * Unconscious shift of emotion, affect, or desire from the original object to a more acceptable, less threatening substitute
        * ==For example get mad at something else instead of instructor==
    * **Rationalization**
        * Subconscious technique for justifying actions that otherwise would be unacceptable
        * Making excuses
        * Learner cannot accept real reasons for their behavior
        * =="I am a very safe pilot, it's the examiner's fault that he doesn't see that."==
        * ==*Might be the first defense mechanism we will see as CFI*==
    * **Fantasy (Daydreaming)**
        * When a learner engages in daydreams about how things should be rather than doing anything about how things are
        * A mental escape from frustrating situations
        * For example dreaming of being a successful airline pilot rather than actually committing to the hard work required to reach that goal.
* **What is the difference between stress and anxiety?**
    * ==**Stress** is the body's response to demands placed upon it.==
        * A certain amount of stress is good since it ==keeps a person alert and prevents complacency.==
        * However, the effects of stress are cumulative and, if not coped with adequately, they eventually add up to an intolerable burden.
    * ==**Anxiety** is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often about something *that is going to happen*==
        * Counter anxiety by emphasizing enjoyment of flying
        * Teach students to cope with their fears
* **How can you develop your instructional communication skills?**
    * ==**RILQI**==
    * ==**Role Playing**==
        * Learner is provided with a general description of a situation and then applies a new skill or knowledge to perform the role
        * e.g. CFI learner flies with another CFI who plays role of student pilot
        * Need to think it terms of SBT
    * ==**Instructional Communication**==
        * Instructors perform better when speaking of something they know very well and for which they have a high level of confidence
        * The instructor should not be afraid to use examples of past experiences to illustrate particular points
        * The aviation learner should know how and why something should be done before doing it
    * ==**Listening**==
        * Listening is "hearing with comprehension."
        * Certain emotions interfere with how learners listen
        * A listener should always ask, what is the purpose of what I am listening to? By doing this, the listener can relate the words to the overall concept.
        * Learner can take notes
        * Know your students before teaching them. Listening goes both ways, both instructor and student need to want to listen to each other.
    * ==**Questioning**==
        * Good questioning can determine how well the learner understands what is being taught
        * Focused questions allow the instructor to concentrate on desired areas
        * Open-ended and closed-ended questions can both be used
        * Effective questions are adapted to the learner
    * ==**Instructional Enhancement**==
        * CFI should continue develop their skills well above the level of material they are teaching.
        * As an instructor: never stop learning

### I.B. The Learning Process

* **What is the definition of Learning?**
    * ==**Learning** - the change in behavior that results from experience and practice.==
* **What is an example of a behaviorism skill that you will teach your student?**
    * Use of checklists
    * Not much deep understanding required to acknowledge their importance, and then to use them.
    * ==For example remembering to use the checklist after landing and rewarding them with praise.==
* **What is an example of a cognitive skill that you will teach your student?**
    * Higher order thinking of cognitive theory goes beyond what I'd consider simply a skill, but rather ==changing how they think, understand, and feel.==
    * ==For example, would teach them to have a positive attitude towards safety, and develop good risk management skills.==
    * Also teach through the use of scenarios good aeronautical decision making.
* **What is a learning plateau? How can you help your student overcome it?**
    * ==A temporarily decreased or stalled rate of learning==
    * Let learner know it's normal, only temporary, and not to get discouraged
    * ==Move to another portion of the curriculum==
    * ==Most likely to occur pre-solo==
        * Pre-solo this can happen with making radio calls and/or landings
    * Also be sure to set expectations ahead of time, and let them know that plateau at this stage is common, and then after solo the rest of private pilot training goes quickly
* **What are the principles (or laws) of learning?**
    * **REEPIR**
        * **Readiness**
            * ==The basic needs of the learner need to be satisfied before he or she is ready or capable of learning==
            * Learners make more progress if they have a clear objective
        * **Effect**
            * ==Behaviors that lead to satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated==
            * Based on the emotional reaction of the learner
        * **Exercise**
            * ==Practice / "use it or lose it"==
        * **Primacy**
            * ==What is learned first is most sticky==
            * Creates strong unshakable impression
            * Important to teach things right the first time
        * **Intensity**
            * ==More vivid learning experience more likely to be remembered==
            * The less intense experiences e.g. classroom learning still very important
        * **Recency**
            * ==What is learned most recently is also sticky==
* **When do you think Scenario Based Training (SBT) is most useful in primary flight training?**
    * ==For teaching higher-order thinking skills / aeronautical decision making. (HOTS/ADM)==
    * Where the student needs to be placed in a unique situation with many possible solutions.
    * For example, a low fuel emergency scenario during a cross-country flight might provide a good example scenario to have the student talk through their ADM, and provide opportunities to understand, critique, and improve their thought process.
* **What is the difference between a slip and a mistake?**
    * ==**Slip** - Knew what to do and just accidentally did something else==
        * ==Planned to do the correct thing and inadvertantly did the wrong thing==
        * e.g. briefed an airspeed, power setting, altitude, or other configuration properly for a maneuver and then just did the wrong thing
    * ==**Mistake** - A judgment or action that is misguided==
        * ==Planned to do the wrong thing and succeeded==
        * Just did not know or do the correct thing, like flying into a thunderstorm because they didn't check the weather.

### I.C. The Teaching Process

* **What are 5 advantages of Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL) over classroom instruction?**
    * Reduces cost
    * Allows flexible schedule
    * Accessible anywhere
    * It's self paced
    * Interactive and can respond to learner inputs
    * Less time can be spent on traditional ground school and can spend more time on integration and correlation of learning
    * Allows instructor to follow student progress

### I.D. Assessment and Critique

* **What are 3 methods of critiquing a student's performance?**
    * ==**Instructor critique**==
        * ==Written or oral==
    * ==**Self-critique**==
        * Good for seeing if students perceptions are correct
        * ==Avoids triggering defense mechanisms==
    * **Individual critique by another learner**
        * Another learner to presents the entire assessment
    * **Small group critique**
        * The class is divided into small groups, each assigned a specific area to analyze
    * **Instructor/learner critique**
        * Instructor leads
        * Members of the class are invited to offer criticism of a performance
    * **Learner-Led Critique**
        * A learner leads the class through the assessment

### I.E. Instructor Responsibilities and Professionalism

* **What are the 5 main responsibilities of CFIs regarding the learning process?**
    * ==**LISES**==
    * **L** - ==Helping students **learn**==
    * **I** - ==Provide adequate **instruction**==
    * **S** - ==Demanding adequate **standards** of performance==
    * **E** - ==**Emphasizing the positive**==
    * **S** - ==Ensuring aviation **safety**==

![5 main responsibilities of instructors. [FAA-H-8083-9B Aviation Instructor's Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/aviation_instructors_handbook) [Chapter 8: Aviation Instructor Responsibilities and Professionalism](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/aviation_instructors_handbook/10_aih_chapter_8.pdf) Figure 8-1.](/img/aih/aih-figure-8-1-instructor-responsibilities.jpg){width=400}

* **How can you ensure that adequate instruction is provided to your student?**
    * ==**CNMFSPQ**==
    * ==Proper design and use of **curriculum**== starting with overall learning objective, blocks, to lesson plans
    * Ensure their ==basic **needs** are met== first before instruction
    * Need to understand students so you can communicate with them well and ==**motivate** them==
    * Explain the purpose for why we are doing different things throughout instruction
    * ==Make learning **fun**,== and remind them of the enjoys of flying
    * Give them ==**safe environment**== in which to learn
    * ==Come **prepared**,== on time, well informed, and be confident
    * ==Ask good **questions**== to see if they are learning and adjust teaching style if needed
    * Present problems and opportunities to apply what they have learned
* **When should ACS/PTS standards be introduced in flight training?**
    * FAA says introduce 3 hours before checkride
        * This was from a previous edition of Aviation Instructor's Handbook, but doesn't seem to be in the latest
    * There is ambiguity in FAA docs about how the ACS/PTS should be used
        * AIH page 5-26: "Another example of enhanced, instructor-oriented material for pilot training is a maneuvers guide or handbook which includes the ACS as an integral part of the description of maneuvers and procedures."
        * Or: "How did your performance compare to the standards in the ACS?"
        * Some FAA written exam sample questions (e.g. King schools) also stated that the ACS/PTS *should* be used in training
        * Other references say that ACS/PTS should *not* be used for training
        * AIH page 8-2: "It should be emphasized that the ACS/PTS book is a testing document, not a teaching document."
        * AIH page 9-1: "The ACS/PTS is not a teaching tool. It is a testing tool."
    * Introducing the standards prematurely could ==create unhelpful stress on a new pilot==
    * It could also ==create complacency in a good pilot== who can fly within the standards early, and then you'd have to tighten up the standards and hold them to a higher standard
    * Introducing the standards too late could increase the amount of time the student is putting in reps flying the maneuvers outside of standards
    * A good time to introduce them is once the student is able to generally perform the maneuver correctly, but not within the standards, and then use the standards to raise the bar
* **What are 5 things that you can do to minimize student frustrations?**
    * ==**MIICCCA**==
    * **M** - ==**Motivate** students==
    * **I** - ==Keep students **informed**==
    * **I** - ==Approach students as **individuals**==
    * **C** - ==Give **credit** when due==
    * **C** - ==**Criticize constructively**==
    * **C** - ==Be **consistent**==
    * **A** - ==**Admit errors**==

* **What are some of the physiological considerations that you need to ensure new students are aware of, and are addressed, prior to flight?**
    * Check that student is well rested, hydrated, well fed, use restroom
    * During flight training, students may react to unfamiliar noises or vibrations, experience unfamiliar sensations due to G-force, or have an uncomfortable feeling in their stomach.
    * It will be hot, bring water bottle
    * ==A sick student does not learn well.==
    * Before medical is issued
        * Does student require glasses to see - make sure they have them for instruction
        * Is student colorblind, for example
* **What traits demonstrate your level of professionalism to your students?**
    * Speak, look, and act professional
    * Be an ambassador for general aviation
    * Keep students motivated and progressing
    * Ensure students flying safely
    * Be humble
    * Strive to improve yourself
    * Remember: students are more likely to follow our example, than our advice
    * Be sincere
    * Accept students as they are
    * Proper language, demeanor, appearance, habits

### I.F. Techniques of Flight Instruction

* Evaluated on the flight portion of the check

### I.G. As it pertains to evaluating and managing risk

* **What is PAVE? IMSAFE? 5Ps? Personal Minimums?**
    * **PAVE** checklist
        * *Use the* ***PAVE checklist*** *to perceive hazards*
        * Identify hazards and personal minimums
        * ==Divides risk into four fundamental risk elements or categories==

            * **Alcohol**
            * **Fatigue**
            * **Eating**
    * **5 Ps**
        * Evaluate the pilot's current situation at key decision points during the flight or when an emergency arises.
        * ==Proactive approach to SRM instead of reactive==
        * The 5P concept relies on the pilot to ==adopt a "scheduled" review of the critical variables at points in the flight where decisions are most likely to be effective.==

    * **Personal minimums**
        * Limits unique to that individual pilot's current level of experience and proficiency
        * ==Criteria more restrictive than minimum legal requirements a pilot sets for themselves to ensure safety==
        * It's critical to understand that just because something is legal doesn't mean it's safe or a good idea
        * Know the criteria that goes into setting personal minimums (PAVE)
            * There are also other criteria not necessarily listed or captured by PAVE that should be considered
            * e.g. does your aircraft have a squawk for scratchy comms that you haven't observed before, but if it ends up manifesting during your flight it will increase pilot workload - consider increasing minimums
            * Mountainous and/or unfamiliar terrain should increase minimums
            * Runway width (e.g. `KHEF` 100 ft vs `KEDU` or `7W4` 50 ft)
        * Less important to have rigidly defined personal minimums committed to memory, and more important to exercise good ADM to weigh the various factors and make safe go/no-go decisions
        * See FAA personal minimums worksheet

    * Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) is a statement authorizing medical certification of, at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, applicants whose disqualifying condition is static or non-progressive.
        * May be issued Letter of Evidence (LOE) that needs to be carried along with medical
        * May involve different levels of tests
            * e.g. Operational Color Vision Test (OCVT), Medical Flight Test (MFT)
    * If you have any concern about potential medical deficiency, good idea to get medical certificate in the early stages of flight training
        * Remember, medical (and student pilot) certificate is required to solo
        * No age limit to log dual received, so potentially could be paying for and receiving a lot of flight training before even being eligible to solo, only to later find out you can't get medical (or it has limitation)

### II.B. Runway Incursion Avoidance

* Applicant taught lesson - see TSA document

### II.C. Visual Scanning and Collision Avoidance

* Checked in flight

### II.D. Principles of Flight

* Applicant taught lesson - see TSA document

### II.E. Airplane Flight Controls

    * Flaps and elevator trim tab
    * Balance moments on aircraft during flight while reducing pilot input

### II.F. Airplane Weight and Balance

* **Review weight and balance calculation from data previously provided.**

### II.G. Navigation and Flight Planning

* **How will you teach your students to find themselves if lost?**
    * ==Start with situational awareness before getting lost==
        * Recall **Situational awareness** is the accurate perception of operational and environmental factors that affect the flight.
            * It is knowing what is going on and what is coming next
        * Use nav log
        * Be looking at landmarks outside during flight (pilotage)
        * Monitoring progress
        * Looking for airports along the way as potentials to divert to
        * Use tools available during flight
        * Monitor with GPS
        * Check VORs along the way (can be fun on long cross country)
    * ==If they do get lost, recall 5 C's==
        * **Circle**: Stay in one spot
        * **Climb**: Better visibility, better signal and communication strength
        * **Communicate**: Ask for vectors to a known location
        * **Confess**: Admit you are lost
        * **Calculate**: Figure out fuel remaining, where to go, groundspeed, distance covered
    * In addition to some of the items above
        * Double check maps and look for landmarks
        * Use secondary navigation systems (GPS, VOR)
            * ==GPS nearest or direct-to==
            * 2x VORs to identify location
            * Use iPad / phone / Stratus / Sentry as backup GPS if airplane GPS fails
        * Check town water towers or airfield names
        * Compare the heading indicator to the magnetic compass, and note the direction of error before resetting
            * Can help determine if you are left or right of course
        * Use ATC (report who you are last known location, heading, airspeed, altitude)
        * Is your GPS destination correct, or did you make a typo that went unnoticed? `KPHL` vs `KPHF`
        * See also `KAUG` vs `KAGS`
            * Augusta Maine vs Augusta Georgia
            * Both a few hundred nautical mile cross country from `KHEF`
            * This example from the FAA guide to flight review
* **What is the difference between a course and a heading?**
    * **Heading**
        * Direction the airplane is pointed
    * **Course**
        * Planned direction of flight as a line drawn over the ground
    * **Track**
        * Actual direction plane is flying
    * Above can be magnetic or true

### II.H. Night Operations

* **Why does our vision need time to adapt from daytime conditions to nighttime conditions?**
    * ==Dark adaptation is the time taken for a (primarily) biochemical reaction to take place==
    * ==Pupil dialation happens in a few seconds up to a minute==
    * Both cones and rods participate in dark adaptation, slowly increasing their sensitivity to light in a dim environment.
        * Cones adapt faster, so the ==first few minutes of adaptation reflect cone-mediated vision.==
        * ==Rods work slower, but since they can perform at much lower levels of illumination, they take over after the initial cone-mediated adaptation period.==
    * Takes about 30 minutes for eyes to fully adjust to darkness
* **When landing at night is it better to fly a long low approach or a normal approach with normal speeds? Why?**
    * There are several night vision illusions discussed in the Airplane Flying Handbook
    * Some of these illusions cause tendency to fly higher than normal approach, others lower
    * Some important things can do
        * If VASI/PAPI is there, use it
        * Can calculate and use a sort of VDP for longer finals
            * $6000\tan(3^\circ)=314$
            * GS Kts * 5 = descent rate in FPM
        * Use instruments
        * If in doubt, go around
    * Nevertheless, in doubt flying too high of an approach is preferably because you can always go-around, whereas flying too low of an approach increases the risk of hitting terrain or obstacles on the ground
* **If you see a green steady light and a flashing red light in front of you while flying, which direction is the aircraft going relative to you?**
    * Green light is on right wing
    * Aircraft is traveling left to right in front of us

### II.I. High Altitude Operations

* **At what cabin altitudes are pilots and flight crew required to use supplemental oxygen?**
    * Note altitudes are *cabin pressure altitudes*
    * 12,500 - 14,000 ft MSL: flight crew uses supplemental oxygen for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration
    * Above 14,000 ft MSL: flight crew must use oxygen
    * Above 15,000 ft MSL: each occupant is *provided* oxygen
* **What are some of the early onset symptoms of hypoxia?**
    * Belligerence
    * Euphoria
    * Headache
    * Decreased response to stimuli and increased reaction time
    * Impaired judgment
    * Visual impairment
    * Drowsiness
    * Lightheaded or dizzy sensation

* **What guidance should you follow when administering a Flight Review?**
    * See [FAA-AC-61-98E Currency Requirements and Guidance for the Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_61-98E.pdf)
    * A flight review consists of a minimum of ==1 hour of flight training and 1 hour of ground== training
    * Send student to ==[FAASafety.gov](https://faasafety.gov) for the free ALC-25 Flight Review Prep Guide== course
    * ==Set expectations==
        * I need to ensure the pilot can safely exercise the privileges of their pilot certificate
        * The minimum requirements may not be sufficient
    * Ask pilot to ==complete short cross country planning session==
        * Weather
        * Decision making
        * Risk management
        * Personal minimums
        * GA security (airspace, TFRs, etc.)

* **If you have completed a flight with a student who came to you for a flight review and they did not fly well enough that you intend to provide them a Flight Review endorsement, what kind of logbook entry do you make and what do you do from there?**
    * Log flight as dual given
    * Discuss areas to improve
    * Offer plan of action (ground and flight training) to return the pilot to proficiency

### III.A. Certificates and Documents

* **What Certificates and Documents are required to be on board an aircraft?**

<!--@include: ./docs/src/includes/required-documents-sparrow.md | shift:3-->

* **What certificates and documents must you carry as a flight instructor in flight?**

<!--@include: ./docs/src/includes/required-documents-ppm.md | shift:3-->

* **What class medical certificate must you have to provide flight instruction? Do you always need to have a medical certificate to instruct?**
    * ==None if not acting as PIC or required crewmember and the other pilot can act as PIC==
        * For example, wouldn't be possible if other pilot was a private, but with lapsed flight review then they couldn't act as PIC
        * Also wouldn't be possible if instructor was acting as PIC while other pilot was under simulated instrument conditions
    * ==To act as PIC (for example with student pilots) just need BasicMed==

### XIII.B. Systems and Equipment Malfunctions

* **If you notice that your oil pressure indicator is indicating zero while in flight, what could be the cause, and what actions will you take?**
    * Causes
        * Bad indication
            * Bad pressure transducer
            * Bad wiring / connection
            * Bad guage
        * Low oil pressure
    * Actions
        * See checklist in POH
        * Check oil temp
        * Any evidence of loss of oil?
        * Land as soon as practicable
        * If oil temp is also increasing, engine failure may be imminent, use minimum power to get to nearest suitable site for emergency landing

### III.D. Performance and Limitations

* **How would you expect your aircraft's performance will be affected by being over its maximum weight allowance? With a CG forward of the limit? With a CG aft of the limit?**
    * CG too far forward
        * Longer takeoff distance
        * Higher stalling speed
        * Reduced elevator effectiveness
        * Increased stability
        * Reduced fuel economy and speed
        * Limit imposed by making sure enough elevator authority to hold the aircraft in normal glide with power off / aircraft's landing characteristics are suitable.
    * CG too far rearward
        * Worse than too far forward
        * Unstable
        * Reduced elevator effectiveness
        * May not be able to recover from a spin
        * Limit imposed by stability (making sure aircraft has correct damping) / stall recovery
    * Heavy
        * Longer takeoff roll
        * Reduced fuel economy and speed
        * Higher stalling speed
