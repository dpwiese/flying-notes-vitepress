## Airworthiness Requirements

### Certificate location and expiration dates

#### What certificates and documentation are required on the aircraft?

* [Required Certificates and Documents](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#required-certificates-and-documents)
* SPARROW

#### Where can you find the airworthiness and registration certificates?

* Baggage compartment.

#### How long is registration good for?

* 7 years.

#### How long is airworthiness certificate good for?

* Forever as long as the plane is maintained in an airworthy condition.

### Required inspections and airplane logbook documentation

#### What inspections are required?

* AVIATES

#### What logbook documentation is required?

* [Logbook Documentation](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#logbook-documentation)
* See link above.
* Know what items are required when you look in the logbooks for evidence of, for example, the annual having been done.

### Airworthiness Directives and Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins

* [Airworthiness Directives](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#airworthiness-directives)
* [Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins (SAIB)](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#special-airworthiness-information-bulletins)

#### What are airworthiness directives?

* Airworthiness Directives s are used to notify aircraft owners and other interested persons of unsafe conditions and to specify the conditions under which the product may continue to be operated.
* ADs are divided into two categories:
  1. Those of an emergency nature requiring immediate compliance prior to further flight
  2. Those of a less urgent nature requiring compliance within a specified period of time
* ADs are regulatory and shall be complied with unless a specific exemption is granted.
* It is the responsibility of the aircraft owner or operator to ensure compliance with all pertinent ADs, including those ADs that require recurrent or continuing action.

#### Can you overflow ADs?

* No.

#### What is a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins (SAIB)?

* Non-regulatory guidance/recommendation that doesn't rise to the level of an AD.

### Purpose and procedure for obtaining a special flight permit

* [Special Flight Permit](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#special-flight-permit)

#### How can you get a special flight permit (ferry permit)?

* FSDO.
* FAA may require an inspection first.

### Pilot-performed preventive maintenance

* [Pilot-Performed Preventive Maintenance](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#pilot-performed-preventive-maintenance)

#### What maintenance can you do on the airplane?

* See list of 31 things in [14 CFR &sect;43 Appendix A(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c))
* Note from [Coleal 2009](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2009/Coleal-Bombardier%20Learjet_2009_Legal_Interpretation.pdf) this list is _not_ controlling, and there _are_ other things which fall under the definition of preventative maintenance that are not listed here.

#### What do you have to log having done?

* Maintenance must be logged.
* So if it is considered _preventative_ maintenance it must be logged.

#### So, you put oil in the plane, do you log that?

* There are certain things the FAA considereds "normal flight preparation" that don't rise to the level of preventative maintenance and therefore do not need to be logged.
* This includes adding oil, cleaning the windshield, for example.

### Equipment requirements for day and night VFR flight

* [Day VFR Required Equipment](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#day-vfr-required-equipment)
* [Night VFR Required Equipment](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#night-vfr-required-equipment)

#### What equipment is required for day VFR?

* A-TOMATO FLAMES

#### What about night VFR?

* FLAPS

### Flying with inoperative equipment

* [Inoperative Equipment Overview](/cfi/preflight-prep/airworthiness#inoperative-equipment-overview)

#### Describe the flow that you would go through to determine, if you found something broken on the aircraft, if you could legally fly.

* MEL
* KOEL
* 14 CFR &sect;91
* AD
* STC
* Affects safety (14 CFR &sect;91.7)

### Using an approved Minimum Equipment List (MEL)

#### What is an MEL?

* A list of things that can be broken and still be able to fly.
* May carry restrictions.

#### Do our Piper Archers have an MEL?

* No.

### Kinds of Operation Equipment List (KOEL)

#### What is a KOEL?

* KOEL specifies the kinds of operations (e.g., VFR, IFR, day, or night) in which the aircraft can be operated.
* Indicates the installed equipment that may affect any operating limitation.
* No standard format, not always called "KOEL" in POH.

#### Do our Piper Archers have a KOEL?

* Yes.
* See Piper Archer POH Page 2-13.

### Required discrepancy records or placards

#### What happens if you go to the plane and find the cabin air fan isn't working?

* Can fly.
* Generally need to placarded and either removed or deactivated, if it is removed, a new weight and balance might need to be computed depending on the weight of the part.
* For fan, pull "vent fan" circuit breaker and print label to mark fan switch as "inoperative".

#### Do you need to make a maintenance logbook entry after having deactivated the fan?

* I think guidance from the FAA via CFRs, AC's and letters of interpretation in the case of pulling a circuit breaker points to "no".
  * That pulling a breaker and putting a lockout clip or zip-tie on does _not_ even rise to the level of preventative maintanence.
  * See [Hochberg 2016](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2016/Hochberg_2016_Legal_Interpretation.pdf).
* [14 CFR &sect;91.213(d)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.213#p-91.213(d)(3)) also says, "_if_ deactivation of the inoperative instrument or equipment involves maintenance" implying that deactivation may be possible that does _not_ involve maintenance.

### The applicant demonstrates the ability to identify, assess and mitigate risks, encompassing Inoperative equipment discovered prior to flight

#### What would you do if you went to preflight for a night cross-country and the interior lights were inoperative?

* Which interior lights?
* VFR or IFR?
* Additional source of lighting, e.g. headlamp?

## Cross-Country Flight Planning

* [Airspace](/cfi/tsa/airspace)

### Altitude selection accounting for terrain and obstacles, glide distance of the airplane, VFR cruising altitudes, and the effect of wind.

### Time, climb and descent rates, course, distance, heading, true airspeed, and groundspeed.
