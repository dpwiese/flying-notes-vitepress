# Normal Approach and Landing

This page covers *Task B. Normal Approach and Landing* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Procedures for Normal and Crosswind Approach and Landing

1. **How to determine landing performance and limitations.**
2. **Configuration, power, and trim.**
3. **Obstructions and other hazards which should be considered.**
4. **A stabilized approach at the recommended airspeed to the selected touchdown area.**
5. **Course of action if selected touchdown area is going to be missed.**
6. **Coordination of flight controls.**
7. **A precise ground track.**
8. **Wind shear and wake turbulence.**
9. **Crosswind procedure.**
10. **Timing, judgment, and control procedure during roundout and touchdown.**
11. **Directional control after touchdown.**
12. **Use of brakes (landplane).**
13. **Use of checklist.**
14. **After landing runway incursion procedures.**

## Common Errors Related to Normal and Crosswind Approach and Landing

* **Improper use of landing performance data and limitations.**
* **Failure to establish approach and landing configuration at appropriate time or in proper sequence.**
* **Failure to establish and maintain a stabilized approach.**
* **Inappropriate removal of hand from throttles.**
* **Improper procedure during roundout and touchdown.**
* **Poor directional control after touchdown.**
* **Improper use of brakes (landplane).**
* **Failure to ensure receipt and acknowledgement of landing clearance.**
* **Failure to review airport diagram for runway exit situational awareness to avoid a runway incursion after landing.**
* Additional common errors are listed in [FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) [Chapter 9: Approaches and Landings](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/10_afh_ch9.pdf) on page 9-10 and 9-20.
