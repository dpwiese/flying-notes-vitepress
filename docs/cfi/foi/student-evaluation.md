# Student Evaluation

This page covers *Task D. Student Evaluation, Assessment, and Testing* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Effective Assessment

1. Characteristics of effective questions
    * Written tests
        * Characteristics (**RVUCD**)
            * **Reliability**
                * Yields consistent results
            * **Validity**
                * Measures what it is supposed to measure
            * **Usability**
                * Easy to give and grade
            * **Comprehensiveness**
                * Effectively measures the overall objectives
                * Liberally samples what is being measured and gives good measurement on overall objectives
            * **Discrimination**
                * Measures small differences between learners distinguishes between learners with high and low achievment
                * Includes all levels of difficulty
                * Measures knowledge of the same topic in many different ways
        * Types
            * Supply
                * Fill in the blank
                * Learner has to organize
                * Disadvantage - cannot be graded with uniformity
            * Selection
                * True false, multiple choice, matching
                * Highly objective, very easy to grade
                * Easier to compare learners performance
                * Easily adapted to statistical analysis
        * Designing test
            * Avoid absolutes like always, never
            * Answers should be about the same length on multiple choice test
            * Create attractive distractors (wrong answers) on multiple choice test
    * Performance tests
        * Checkride, for example
        * Desirable to evaluate training that involves procedure, operation, or process
        * **Criterion referenced**
            * Practical tests are an example - they are to the ACS and not a curve or anything else
        * **Norm referenced**
            * System of testing in which learners are ranked against the performance of other learners.
2. Types of questions to avoid

## Traditional Assessments

* Involves written testing (e.g., multiple choice, matching) and grading
* Pretest
    * Criterion-referenced test constructed to measure the knowledge and skills necessary to begin the course

## Authentic Assessments

* Focuses on the learning process
* Enhances the development of real-world skills
* Encourages higher order thinking skills (HOTS)
* Teaches learners to assess their own work and performance

### Learner-centered assessment

* TBD

### Maneuver or procedure grades

* TBD

### Assessing risk management skills

* TBD

## Choosing an Effective Assessment Method

* TBD

## Purposes and Types of Critiques

1. Instructors/student critique
    * An effective critique should be
        * Objective
        * Flexible
        * Acceptable
        * Comprehensive
        * Constructive
        * Well organized
        * Thoughtful
        * Specific
    * Critique should be delivered immediately after learners performance so they can remember the details
    * Assessment / critique not part of grading
    * Critique should be objective, constructive, thoughtful
        * Focus on strengthening areas of weakness
    * Critique should be flexible enough to the occasion and learner
    * For learner to accept critique they first need to accept the instructor
    * Methods
        * Instructor critique
        * Learner led critique
        * Self critique
        * Instructor/learner critique
    * Critique
        * Constructive
        * Clear
        * Consistent
        * Admit your own errors
2. Student-lead critique
3. Small group critique
4. Individual student critique by another student
5. Self-critique
6. Written critique

## Oral Assessment

* Most practical means of evaluation
* Reveals effectiveness of instructor's training
* Questions should be brief / concise but suitably difficult to challenge learner
* Questions can be
    * Fact - memory / recall
    * Thought - requires thinking
* Oral quizzing
    * Identifies which points need more emphasis
* Oral assessment
    * Direct (when, where)
    * Indirect (why, how of objective)

### Answering learner questions

* TBD

## Assessment of Piloting Ability

* Evaluation refers to judging a learner's ability to perform a maneuver or procedure.
* Evaluation of demonstrated ability during flight or maintenance instruction is based upon established standards of performance, suitably modified to apply to the learner's experience and stage of development as a pilot or mechanic.
* When evaluating learner demonstrations of ability, the aviation instructor should keep the learner informed of progress.
