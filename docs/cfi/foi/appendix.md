## Definitions

* **Behavior** - the product of factors that cause people to act in predictable ways.
* **Learning** - the change in behavior that results from experience and practice.
* **Insight** - the grouping of affiliated perceptions into meaningful wholes.
* **Perception** - give meaning to sensations being experienced.
  * *Is the basis of all learning.*
* **Motivation** - the reason one acts or behaves in a certain way and lies at the heart of goals.
* **Tangible motivation** - the learner must believe their efforts will be rewarded in a definitive and tangible manner
* **Positive motivations** - can be subtle and difficult to identify
* **Incidental learning** - learning more than originally intended
* **Mental model** - refers to an organized collection of ideas that forms a learner's understanding of a thing or process, and evolve as new information is learned.
* **Recoding** - taking new information and relating it existing knowledge and building new relationships
* **Mnemonic** - uses a pattern of letters, ideas, visual images, or associations to assist in remembering information and include but are not limited to acronyms, acrostics, rhymes, and chaining.
* **Precoding** - a selective process where the sensory register is set to recognize certain stimuli and immediately transmit them to the short-term memory (STM) for action. An example of sensory precoding is recognition of a fire alarm.
* **Praise** - a response that gives a pleasurable return and stimulates remembering.
