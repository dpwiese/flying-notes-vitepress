# 14 CFR and Publications

This page covers *Task J. 14 CFR and Publications* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

* Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is the codification of the general and permanent rules published by the executive departments and agencies of the United States Government.
* The regulations are divided into 50 different codes, called Titles, that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation.
* Heirarchy for 14 CFR is as below.
* Heirarchy for 49 CFR is different.
* **Title** 14: Aeronautics and Space
  * **Chapter** I: Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation
    * **Subchapter** A: Definitions and General Requirements
      * **Part** 1: Definitions and Abbreviations / **Section** 1: General definitions
* The primary things of concern to pilots are in Chapter I of Title 14.
* Looking at the subchapter level is the best place to start narrowing down a topic we might be interested in.

## 14 CFR Parts 1, 61, and 91

## 49 CFR Part 830

## Advisory Circulars, INFOs, and SAFOs

### Advisory Circulars

* An Advisory Circular (AC) is an informational document that the FAA wants to distribute to the aviation community.
* This can be in the form of a text book used in a classroom or a one page document.
  * [FAA-AC-00-6B Aviation Weather](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1029851)
  * [FAA-AC-00-45H Aviation Weather Services](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1030235)
* ACs provide a single, uniform, agency-wide system that the FAA uses to deliver advisory material to FAA customers, industry, the aviation community, and the public.
* An AC may be needed to
  * Provide an acceptable, clearly understood method for complying with a regulation
  * Standardize implementation of a regulation or harmonize implementation for the international aviation community
  * Resolve a general misunderstanding of a regulation
  * Respond to a request from some government entity, such as General Accounting Office, NTSB, or the Office of the Inspector General
  * Help the industry and FAA effectively implement a regulation
  * Explain requirements and limits of an FAA grant program
  * Expand on standards needed to promote aviation safety, including the safe operation of airports
* There are three parts to an AC number, as in 25-42C.
  * The first part of the number identifies the subject matter area of the AC and corresponds to the appropriate 14 CFR part.
    * For example, an AC on "Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors" is numbered as AC 61-65E.
    * Since ACs are numbered sequentially within each subject area, the second part of the number beginning with the dash identifies this sequence.
    * The third part of the number is a letter assigned by the originating office and shows the revision sequence if an AC is revised.

### INFOs

* TBD

### SAFOs

* TBD

## ACS and PTS

* The FAA has developed PTS for FAA pilot certificates and associated ratings.
* In 2015, the FAA began transitioning to the ACS approach.
* The ACS is essentially an "enhanced" version of the PTS.
  * It adds task - specific knowledge and risk management elements to each PTS Area of Operation and Task.
* The result is a holistic, integrated presentation of specific knowledge, skills, and risk management elements and performance metrics for each Area of Operation and Task.
* The ACS evaluation program will eventually replace the PTS program for evaluating and certifying pilots.
* The PTS book is a testing document and not intended to be a training syllabus.

## POH and AFM

### FAA Approved Pilot Operating Handbooks / AFM

* Flight manuals and operating handbooks are concise reference books that provide specific information about a particular aircraft or subject.
* They contain basic facts, information, and/or instructions for the pilot about the operation of an aircraft, flying techniques, etc., and are intended to be kept on hand for ready reference.
* The aircraft owner/information manual is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains general information about the make and model of the aircraft.
* The manual is not approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is not specific to an individual aircraft.
* The manual provides general information about the operation of an aircraft, is not kept current, and cannot be substituted for the AFM/POH.

* An AFM is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and approved by the FAA. This book contains the information and instructions required to operate an aircraft safely.
* A pilot must comply with this information which is specific to a particular make and model of aircraft, usually by serial number.
* An AFM contains the operating procedures and limitations of that aircraft.
* Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 requires that pilots comply with the operating limitations specified in the approved flight manuals, markings, and placards.

* Originally, flight manuals followed whatever format and content the manufacturer felt was appropriate, but this changed with the acceptance of Specification No. 1 prepared by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA).
* Specification No. 1 established a standardized format for all general aviation airplane and helicopter flight manuals.

* The POH is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information. If "POH" is used in the main title, a statement must be included on the title page indicating that sections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM.

* The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual. The typical AFM/POH contains the following nine sections
  * 1. General
  * 2. Limitations
  * 3. Emergency Procedures
  * 4. Normal Procedures
  * 5. Performance
  * 6. Weight and Balance/Equipment List
  * 7. Systems Description
  * 8. Handling, Service, and Maintenance
  * 9. Supplements
* Manufacturers also have the option of including additional sections, such as one on Safety and Operational Tips or an alphabetical index at the end of the POH.

### AFM vs POH

* Aircraft owner/information manual is *not* approved by the FAA and is not a substitute for the *approved* POH/AFM
  * The POH is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information.
  * If "POH" is used in the main title, a statement must be included on the title page indicating that sections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM.
  * The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual.
* Manuals follow standard format
* AFM vs POH/PIM
  * AFM regulated by FAA and specific to airplane
  * POH/PIM general aircraft info
  * POH is standardized by the General Aviation Manufacturer's Association
    * [GAMA Specification 1, rev 1996](https://gama.aero/documents/gama-specification-1-specification-for-pilots-operating-handbook-version-2-0/)

> The title [of the document shall be] "Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual" for all airplanes except those for which the airplane manufacturer elected to provide a separate FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual. In the latter case, the title shall be "Pilot's Operating Handbook".

> Note: After the effective date of this revision, Pilot's Operating Handbooks for newly manufactured airplanes must be FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manuals.

## Aeronautical Information Manual

* Also known as the AIM
* The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) is the official guide to basic flight information and ATC procedures for the aviation community flying in the NAS of the United States.
