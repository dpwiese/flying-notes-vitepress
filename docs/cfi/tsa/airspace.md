# National Airspace System

This page covers *Task G. National Airspace System* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Airspace Classes

![VFR airspace entry requirements. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 15: Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/17_phak_ch15.pdf) Figure 15-9](/img/vfr-entry-requirements.png){width=540}

### VFR Weather Minimums

![VFR weather minimums. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 15: Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/17_phak_ch15.pdf) Figure 15-8](/img/vfr-weather-minimums.png){width=540}

### Two-Way Radio Communication

* Two-way radio communication requirement is met when ATC uses your aircraft ID (tail number or callsign).
* For example, if ATC says "aircraft calling standby" this does *not* constitute two-way communication.
* If ATC says "N12345 standby" that does.

Who to talk to when *transiting* D airspace?

[14 CFR &sect;91.129(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.129#p-91.129(c)(1)) says:

> Each person must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility (including foreign ATC in the case of foreign airspace designated in the United States) providing air traffic services prior to entering that airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within that airspace.

It's not 100 percent clear from the above which ATC facility is providing air traffic services.
So the question is, for a D airport, which ATC facility is providing air traffic services?
And so do we need to talk to *tower* to transit D airspace?
Or just any ATC facility?

Well, not any, for example wouldn't make sense if we were talking to tower at a nearby airport.

[Boldmethod Youtube: How To Use VFR Flight Following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJs5LLKmvZc)

Seems any ATC (e.g. approach) that is giving a clearance (e.g. vectors) is sufficient.
See [JO 7110.65W 2−1−16](https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/order/atc.pdf) that is a document that prescribes procedures to ATC, and says that approach control will coordinate with tower before issuing a clearance.
That document seems like the AIM for ATC.
Also: [7110.65](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/)

But on flight following, for example, a clearance isn't issued, so does this count?
Is there anywhere where it says explicitly which facility is providing services for which airspace?

It seems flight following does not satisfy the requirement of talking to the facility that is providing air traffic services to enter D airspace.
So be sure to ask ATC when on flight following if you are cleared before entering D airspace - it is responsibility of pilot in command to follow [14 CFR &sect;91.129 - Operations in Class D airspace](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.129).

See [Granby 2006 Legal Interpretation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2006/Granby_2006_Legal_Interpretation.pdf)

*Note: can find a list of FAA Legal interpretation letters at the [FAA Regulations Division Legal Interpretations & Chief Counsel's Opinions](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/) page*

Who to first talk to when *entering* D airspace *for landing*?

[Aviation StackExchange Is it required to contact approach when flying VFR into a Class D airfield?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/328/is-it-required-to-contact-approach-when-flying-vfr-into-a-class-d-airfield)

> For instance, while you won't find it on the charts, A/FD or NOTAMs, the ATIS at KADS always says "contact Regional Approach on 124.3 and advise you have information [letter]" rather than the usual "advise on initial contact you have information [letter]". If you try calling Tower directly, they will tell you to remain clear and contact Approach.

### Special VFR

* Provides IFR separation even though not doing IFR operation
* Must be requested by pilot and approved by ATC
* Need 1 SM visibility and clear of clouds
* If at night, pilot and plane need to be instrument rated
* Can do in controlled airspace up to 10,000 MSL (something about airspace to ground?)
* If ground visibility not reported, just need 1 SM flight visibility
* Some airports do not permit special VFR
* *Q: Is there any real reason to ever do special VFR? It seems dumb.*
* [14 CFR &sect;91.157 - Special VFR weather minimums](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.157)
  * During the day, SVFR requires
    * ATC clearance
    * 1 SM visibility
    * Clear of clouds
  * At night, the pilot must be instrument rated and the aircraft must be IFR equipped.

![Airspace communication requirements and weather minimums. Reference unknown.](/img/airspace-at-a-glance.jpg){width=540}

### Controlled Airspace

* **Class A**
  * [AIM 3-2-2](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-2)
  * Above 18,000 feet, FL is used
  * FL180 – FL60
  * Active across entire NAS + 12 nm off the coast
  * Requirements: IFR Flight Plan
  * DME over FL240
    * [14 CFR &sect;91.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205)
* **Class B**
  * [AIM 3-2-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-3)
  * SFC to 10,000 MSL
  * B = Busy
  * Upside down wedding cake
  * Must be cleared to enter
  * Solid blue line on VFR chart
  * VFR coordidors sometimes exist as small paths through B airspace
* **Class C**
  * [AIM 3-2-4](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-4)
  * Less busy than B, but still high volume of large aircraft
  * SFC to 4,000 MSL
  * 5 nm core, 10 nm radius, where outer shelf starts at 1,200 ft
  * Two-way radio communication to enter (note tail number)
  * Solid magenta line on VFR chart
  * Spacing / separation: [7110.65 Section 8. Class C Service- Terminal 7-8-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap7_section_8.html)
* **Class D**
  * [AIM 3-2-5](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-5)
  * Operating control tower
  * SFC – 2,500 ft
  * 5 sm / 4.4 nm Radius
  * Two-way radio communication to enter
  * Dashed blue line on VFR chart
  * When a D airspace tower closes, the airspace becomes E to surface, unless weather/communication is not available at the surface, then it is E only down to 700.
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.129 - Operations in Class D airspace](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.129)
* **Class E**
  * [AIM 3-2-6](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_2.html#$paragraph3-2-6)
  * Any controlled airspace that is not A-D
  * Class E airspace below 14,500 feet MSL is charted on Sectional, Terminal, and IFR Enroute Low Altitude charts.
  * *So technically the default is G up to 14,500 unless otherwise charted*
  * ==However, with very few exceptions (see class G airspace below) class E is charted to start at either 700' or 1200' AGL==
    * ==So basically the default is that E starts at 1200' AGL except where charted to start at 700' AGL, or where shown to *not* to start at 1200' AGL.==
    * This can be seen along the US border, where it shows the start of E at 1,200'
  * 700/1200 ft AGL – 18,000 ft MSL (A), up to 12 nm off US coast
  * "1200 ft, except where the elephant steps"
  * VFR chart Colors
    * To surface: dashed magenta
    * 700 ft floor: ombre magenta
    * 1200 ft floor: ombre blue
      * Note: ombre is a French word meaning shaded, where one hue blends to another
* Weather, Aircraft, Pilot Requirements

### Uncontrolled Airspace

* **Class G**
  * [AIM 3-3](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap3_section_3.html)
  * SFC – Base of class E
  * Even though there is no ATC, still minimum requirements to comply with FAA
  * In certain designated areas class G extends up to 14,500 feet
    * This is on VFR charts, but easier to see on IFR charts

![Class G airspace to 14,500 as depicted on IFR charts. [Aeronautical Chart Users' Guide - IFR Enroute Products Only Edition](https://aeronav.faa.gov/user_guide/20220714/cug-ifr-enroute-edition.pdf)](/img/ifr-chart-user-guide-class-g-to-14500.jpg){width=540}

### Transponder and ADS-B Requirements

* Mode-C Transponder requirements
  * Used in general aviation are mode A
  * If it can do altitude encoding it has mode C capability
  * ==Above 10,000 MSL, unless witihin 2,500 AGL==
  * ==In class A, B, and C airspace==
  * ==Within horizontal limits of Class B mode-C veil (30 nm)==
  * Within 10 nm of certain designated airports, excluding airspace which is both outside the Class D surface area and below 1,200' AGL
  * Flying into, within, or across the ADIZ
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.215(b)(5)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.215)

* [14 CFR &sect;91.155 - Basic VFR weather minimums](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.155)
  * The exception noted in the figure below in G airspace within 1200 AGL:

  > Airplane, powered parachute, or weight-shift-control aircraft. If the visibility is less than 3 statute miles but not less than 1 statute mile during night hours and you are operating in an airport traffic pattern within 1⁄2 mile of the runway, you may operate an airplane, powered parachute, or weight-shift-control aircraft clear of clouds.

  * *So does this mean if the visibility is more than 3 statute miles at night, you wouldn't not be allowed to operate clear of clouds while in the traffic pattern and within 1/2 mile? Seems so as written, but a bit not obvious as to why.*

* [FAA Equip ADS-B](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/equipadsb/)
* [14 CFR &sect;91.225 - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment and use](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.225)
  * Class A, B, and C airspace
  * Class E airspace at or above 10,000 feet msl
    * Excluding airspace at and below 2,500 feet agl
  * Within 30 nautical miles of a Class B primary airport (the Mode C veil)
  * Above the ceiling and within the lateral boundaries of Class B or Class C airspace up to 10,000 feet
  * Class E airspace over the Gulf of Mexico, at and above 3,000 feet msl, within 12 nm of the U.S. coast.
* [14 CFR &sect;91.227 - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment performance requirements](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.227)
* **Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)**
  * **Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B)**
    * Provides traffic information to planes with ADS-B receivers
    * The traffic includes that which is not broadcasting its own output via ADS-B, because it's able to use radar data and conventional transponder data to understand where aircraft are
  * **Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B)**
    * Provides NEXRAD graphical weather in (for example in G1000)
    * Also provides info on SUA and TFRs
  * ADS-B uses plane's GPS and broadcasts information to other planes and ground stations
  * Ground stations compile and rebroadcast received information

### Airspace Speed Limits

* The diagram below kind of sucks.
* For C and D airspace, within 4 nm and within 2,500 AGL of the primary airport, the speed limit is 200 KIAS.
* ==Speed limits are in knots *indicated airspeed*.==

![Airspace speed limits. [14 CFR &sect;91.117 - Aircraft speed](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.117) (unknown reference)](/img/airspace_speed_limits.jpg){width=540}

### Overlapping Airspace

* As an example, see some airspace around `KBFI`, `KRNT`, and `KSEA` -- there is D airspace that extends upwards into B.
* See [14 CFR &sect;71.9 - Overlapping airspace designations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-71/section-71.9):

> When overlapping airspace designations apply to the same airspace, the operating rules associated with the more restrictive airspace designation apply.
