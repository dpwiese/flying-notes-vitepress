# High Altitude Operations - Supplemental Oxygen

This page covers *Task N. High Altitude Operations - Supplemental Oxygen* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

## Regulatory Requirements for Supplemental Oxygen

<!--@include: ./docs/includes/oxygen-requirements.md-->

## Physiological Factors

### Hypoxia

<!--@include: ./docs/includes/hypoxia.md-->

#### Using Oxygen

* Take oxygen gradually to build up in small doses - the sudden supply of pure oxygen following decompression can aggravate hypoxia.
* Prolonged oxygen use can be harmful to health.
* 100% aviation oxygen can create toxic symptoms if used for too long.
  * Symptoms: bronchial cough, fever, vomiting, nervousness, irregular heartbeat, lowered energy.

#### Nitrogen

* Decompression sickness-evolving and expanding gases in the body.
  * Trapped gas-expanding/contracting gas in cavities during altitude changes can result in abdominal pain, toothache, or pain in ears and sinuses if the pressure change isn't equalized.
  * Evolved gas-with a sufficient pressure drop, nitrogen forms bubbles which can have adverse effects on some body issues.
  * Scuba diving compounds this problem.
    * See more on scuba in aeromedical factors section

#### Vision

* ==Vision becomes impaired with lack of oxygen, especially at night==

## Operational factors

### Importance of Aviator's Breathing Oxygen

* Specified at 99.5% pure oxygen.
* Not more than 0.005 mg of water per liter.
* Medical oxygen-has too much water, which can collect in various parts of the system and freeze, reducing or stopping the flow of oxygen.
* Industrial oxygen-not intended for breathing, may have impurities in it.

### Care and Storage of Oxygen Bottles

Portable oxygen equipment must be accessible in flight if the airplane does not have a fixed installation.
Oxygen usually stored at 1,800-2,200 psi. When the ambient temperature surrounding the cylinder decreases, the pressure within the cylinder will decrease-no reason to suspect supply depletion if you notice a drop in indicated pressure.

Fire danger-materials that are nearly fire proof in ordinary air may be susceptible to burning in pure oxygen. Oils and greases may catch fire if exposed to pure oxygen and cannot be in oxygen systems. Smoking is prohibited during any kind of oxygen equipment use.

Thoroughly inspect and test all oxygen equipment before each flight. Available supply, operational check, assure it is readily available. Do periodic inspections and servicing.

PRICE checklist to inspect oxygen equipment

* **P** - Pressure - is there enough oxygen pressure and quantity to complete the flight
* **R** - Regulator
* **I** - Indicator - check to assure steady flow of oxygen
* **C** - Connections - all secured
* **E** - Emergency - have equipment readily available, brief passengers

### Rapid Decompression and Solutions

* Decompression-the inability of the pressurization system to maintain its designated differential pressure.
* May be caused by a malfunction in the pressurization system or structural damage to the plane.
* Decompression types
  * **Explosive decompression**
    * Change in cabin pressure faster than the lungs can decompress
    * Less than 0.5 seconds
  * **Rapid decompression**
    * Change in cabin pressure where lungs can decompress faster than the cabin
    * No likelihood of lung damage
* During explosive decompression, there may be noise, and one may feel dazed for a second
* During most decompressions, the cabin will fill with
  * Fog (the result of the rapid change in temperature and change of relative humidity)
  * Dust
  * Flying debris
* Air will rush from the mouth and nose due to the escape from the lungs
* Differential air pressure on either side of the eardrum should clear automatically
* Exposure to wind blast and extremely cold temperatures may occur
* Primary danger-hypoxia.
  * If proper use of oxygen equipment is not accomplished quickly, could quickly result in unconsciousness.
  * Effective performance time-reduced to one third or one fourth of its normal time.
* Recovery
  * Don oxygen masks
  * Emergency descent
  * Top priority: reaching safe altitude. Be aware that rapid descent from high altitude could result in cold shock in piston engines, and cylinder cracking.
  * For explosive decompression, the time to make a recovery before loss of useful consciousness is even less.
