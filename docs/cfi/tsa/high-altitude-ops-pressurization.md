# High Altitude Operations - Pressurization

This page covers *Task O. High Altitude Operations - Pressurization* from the [FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf).

### Effects of Rapid Decompression

* Decompression-the inability of the pressurization system to maintain its designated differential pressure.
* May be caused by a malfunction in the pressurization system or structural damage to the plane.
* Decompression types
  * **Explosive decompression**
    * Change in cabin pressure faster than the lungs can decompress
    * Less than 0.5 seconds
  * **Rapid decompression**
    * Change in cabin pressure where lungs can decompress faster than the cabin
    * No likelihood of lung damage
* During explosive decompression, there may be noise, and one may feel dazed for a second
* During most decompressions, the cabin will fill with
  * Fog (the result of the rapid change in temperature and change of relative humidity)
  * Dust
  * Flying debris
* Air will rush from the mouth and nose due to the escape from the lungs
* Differential air pressure on either side of the eardrum should clear automatically
* Exposure to wind blast and extremely cold temperatures may occur
* Primary danger-hypoxia.
  * If proper use of oxygen equipment is not accomplished quickly, could quickly result in unconsciousness.
  * Effective performance time-reduced to one third or one fourth of its normal time.
* Recovery
  * Don oxygen masks
  * Emergency descent
  * Top priority: reaching safe altitude. Be aware that rapid descent from high altitude could result in cold shock in piston engines, and cylinder cracking.
  * For explosive decompression, the time to make a recovery before loss of useful consciousness is even less.
