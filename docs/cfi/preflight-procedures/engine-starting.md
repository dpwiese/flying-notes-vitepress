## Starting Under Various Conditions

* **Safety precautions related to starting.**
  * ==Most important thing is to make sure the prop areas are cleared before starting each engine==
  * ==Also need to be familiar with emergency procedures during starting==
    * Engine fire during start
      * Refer to POH/AFM for proper procedures, the below bullets are general guidance, see image below
      * If engine fails to start, mixture idle cutoff, keep cranking, fuel selector off, battery and alternator off
      * If engine starts, run the throttle up to about 1800 RPM for 20 seconds and then shut down
  * There are many factors to consider when it comes to which engine to start first
    * Recall John King from King school multiengine course
    * Engine that starts more easily
    * Distance from battery
      * Start the engine closer to battery first
    * Better being able to hear the second engine start
      * Start the engine on pilot side second
    * Engine start relative to onboarding passengers
      * Start the engine further from onboarding passengers first
    * Engine which is most visible from pilot seat (left)
