# Fuel System

* Fuel delivery systems for reciprocating engines
  * Carburetor Systems
    * Two types
      * Float-type
      * Pressure-type
    * Float type is most common in small aircraft
    * ==Biggest disadvantage is icing==
      * Drop in temperature due to fuel vaporization takes place within the venturi
      * ==Carburetor ice is most likely to occur when temperatures are below 70 &#176;F or 21 &#176;C and the relative humidity is above 80 percent.==
      * ==The first indication is decreased RPM / manifold pressure==
      * Most likely and dangerous when reducing power and descending
      * Carb heat used for anti-icing (or alternate source of air if air filter clogs)
      * ==Carb heat causes decrease in power up to 15 percent==
      * If detected, full carburetor heat should be applied immediately, and it should be left in the ON position until the pilot is certain that all the ice has been removed.
      * If ice is present, applying partial heat or leaving heat on for an insufficient time might aggravate the situation
      * Whenever the throttle is closed during flight, the engine cools rapidly and vaporization of the fuel is less complete than if the engine is warm. Also, in this condition, the engine is more susceptible to carburetor icing.
    * Carb heat bypasses air filter
      * Can be used in case of air filter blockage
      * Carb heat off on short final to soft fields
  * Fuel injection
    * The following are advantages of using fuel injection:
      * Reduction in evaporative icing
      * Better fuel flow
      * Faster throttle response
      * Precise control of mixture
      * Better fuel distribution in cylinders
      * Easier cold weather starts
    * The following are disadvantages of using fuel injection:
      * Difficulty in starting a hot engine
      * Vapor locks during ground operations on hot days
      * Problems associated with restarting an engine that quits because of fuel starvation
* Mixture control
  * Total mass of air in a given volume decreases with altitude
  * Mixture used to decrease mass of fuel entering the cylinder as mass of air decreases
* Gravity-feed vs fuel-pump systems
  * The gravity-feed system utilizes the force of gravity to transfer the fuel from the tanks to the engine.
  * Aircraft with fuel-pump systems have two fuel pumps. The main pump system is engine driven with an electrically-driven auxiliary pump provided for use in engine starting and in the event the engine pump fails.
* Fuel grades
  * 80 Red
  * 100 Green
  * 100LL Blue
  * JET A Straw
  * G100UL Orange (amber)
* Fuel tanks
  * Fuel tank venting
  * Fuel tanks should be filled after each flight or after the last flight of the day to prevent moisture condensation within the tank
  * Hotter it is, more water can be dissolved in fuel
  * Importance of sumping fuel
  * Fuel system icing
* SAFETY: Carb icing, vapor lock
  * Don't run fuel tank to empty
  * If vapor locked on hot day when starting, point aircraft into wind and open oil access door
* Refueling
  * SAFETY: Static electricity, grounding procedures
* Fuel gauges
  * Only are required to read empty when tanks are empty
  * Verify visually and/or with dip stick
* Flooded engine
  * Increases risk of engine fire
  * See emergency procedures for the aircraft what to do in event of engine fire during start
