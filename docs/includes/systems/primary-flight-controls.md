* ==Some of the diagrams and images in this section show a single engine aircraft, but many concepts and systems are shared between single and multiengine planes==
* Airplanes are maneuvered by *changing the direction of lift*.
* There are three axes about which moments are applied and the aircraft rotates.
* **Primary flight control systems** and associated surfaces created the moments to cause rotations about each of these three axes.
  * Different primary flight control surfaces
    * Elevator
    * Aileron
    * Rudder
    * More
      * V-tail
      * Stabilator
  * Differential ailerons
  * Adverse yaw
