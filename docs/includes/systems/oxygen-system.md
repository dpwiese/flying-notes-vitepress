# Oxygen System

* In a mixture of gases, each constituent gas has a **partial pressure** which is the notional pressure of that constituent gas as if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature.
* Components
  * Mask/cannula
  * Supply (bottle/air bleed)
  * Regulator
* *For optimum protection, pilots are encouraged to use supplemental oxygen above 10,000 feet cabin altitude during the day and above 5,000 feet at night.*
* Most regulators provide 100% cabin air at around 8,000 ft, and 100% oxygen at 34,000 ft, with the ratio changing in between.
* Be aware of the danger of fire when using oxygen
* Masks
  * Face worn mask or cannula
  * Most masks are the oronasal type that covers only the mouth and nose
  * Cannula only goes in nose. More comfortable, but is not as reliable at providing adequate oxygen.
  * Current regulations require aircraft with oxygen systems installed and certified for operations above 18,000 feet to be equipped with oxygen masks instead of cannulas.
* Oxygen delivery systems
  * **Diluter-Demand**
    * Supply oxygen only when the user inhales through the mask
    * Used up to 40,000 ft
  * **Pressure-Demand**
    * Supply oxygen to mask at positive pressure above 34,000 ft
    * Used above 40,000 ft
  * **Continuous-Flow**
    * Most common kind in general aviation aircraft
    * Usually provided for passengers
  * **Electrical Pulse-Demand**
    * provide oxygen flow during the initial portion of inhalation
    * do not waste oxygen during the breathing cycle
    * reduce oxygen 50-85 percent compared to continuous-flow

# Pressurization

* Aircraft more efficient at altitude
* Can help avoid bad weather
* Cabin pressure typically maintained at 8,000 feet
* Differential pressure puts stress on airframe
* Decompression
  * Rapid / explosive
  * Dangers
    * Hypoxia
    * Gas decompression sickness (nitrogen bubbles out of blood)
* Relief valve
* Gauges to monitor pressure
* Cabin, flight, and baggage compartments are incorporated into a sealed unit capable of containing air under a differential pressure.
  * Maximum differential pressure varies by airplane - be familiar with limitations
  * Turbine-powered aircraft-bleed air from engine compressor section used to pressurized
  * Light aircraft-turbocharger's compressor/engine-driven pneumatic pump used to pressurize. Compression heats the air, so it's routed through a heat exchange unit before entering the cabin.

* Provides pressure regulation, pressure relief, and vacuum relief, as well as the means for selecting the desired cabin altitude.
* Uses a cabin pressure regulator, an outflow valve, and a safety valve.
  *  Cabin pressure regulator (CPR)-controls cabin pressure.
    * If we reach the maximum difference, an increase in outside altitude will result in an increase inside.
  * Outflow valve-keeps pressure constant by regulating flow of compressed air.
  *  Safety valve-combination of a pressure relief, vacuum relief, and a dump valve.
* Pressure relief-prevents cabin pressure from exceeding a predetermined differential pressure above ambient pressure. Vacuum relief-prevents ambient pressure from exceeding cabin pressure by allowing external air to enter when ambient pressure exceeds cabin pressure.
* Dump valve-dumps cabin air to atmosphere.
  *  Cockpit switch.
*  Cabin differential pressure gauge-indicates the difference between inside and outside pressure.
* Cabin altimeter-shows altitude inside the airplane. Differential pressure gauge and cabin altimeter could be combined into one instrument.
* Cabin rate of climb/descent.
