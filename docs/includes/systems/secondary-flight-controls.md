# Secondary Flight Controls

::: warning Secondary Flight Controls
Those which are not considered primary and are used to change the aircraft's performance, or reduce the amount of control a pilot has to use.
:::

* **Secondary flight control systems**
  * They may consist of wing flaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim systems.
  * Flaps
    * **Plain Flaps**
    * **Split Flaps**
      * Creates least change in pitching moment
    * **Slotted Flaps**
    * **Fowler Flaps**
      * Produces greatest change in pitching moment
      * Greatest increase in lift with minimal changes in drag
  * Slots
    * Located on the leading edge
    * Allows higher angles of attack by redirecting airflow from under the wing to the top delaying separation

## Flaps, Slots, and Spoilers

::: info NOTE
At the most fundamental level, flaps change the shape of the wing with the primary goal of changing the relationship between lift and drag.
:::

* Flaps
  * For example to permit a higher $C_{L}$ for a given $C_{D}$ thus permitting slower flight for takeoff and landing.
  * Alternatively flaps my permit a larger $C_{D}$ for a given $C_{L}$, enabling the aircraft to better slow down.
  * *Basically - flaps shift the drag bucket to obtain the desired $C_{D}$ at a given $C_{L}$*.
* The relationship between lift and drag is often plotted on a **drag curve** which is a generic term to describe a plot of drag (or the drag coefficient) versus a number of other variables.
  * One of these variables is lift (or the lift coefficient) in what is called a **drag polar** or **drag bucket**.
  * From [Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Vehicle Dynamics, Third Edition](https://doi.org/10.2514/4.102509):

    > We go back to the latter part of the 19th century and find Otto Lilienthal experimenting with hang gliders. He took his hobby very seriously and is credited with relating lift and drag by what he called "die Flugpolare" (the drag polar).

* Flaps change the camber of the wing's airfoil and thus the zero-lift angle of attack
* Flaps also move the center of pressure (CP) aft on the airfoil
  * This effect results in a nose-down pitching moment
  * Other effects are change in airflow over horizontal stabilizer (e.g. more downwash contributing nose-up pitching moment), and increase in drag above the CG which may have different effects depending on the airplane.
  * Such secondary effects are typically not as obvious

So for example in the figure above, if takeoff $C_{L}$ is 2.0, then flaps are needed to be able to achieve this $C_{L}$.
In the following picture, can see how the drag bucket changes for the given airfoil with different flap settings.
