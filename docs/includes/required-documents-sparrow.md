# Required Certificates and Documents

* ==Use the **SPARROW** acronym to remember certificates and documents required to be on board an aircraft.==
  * ==**S** - **Supplements**==
  * ==**P** - **Placards**==
    * The placards that should be on the plane are listed in the POH
  * ==**A** - **Airworthiness certificate**==
    * Means aircraft is safe for flight
    * Remains valid as long as maintenance is done
  * ==**R** - **Registration**==
    * Valid for 3 years (Now 7 years)
    * Required to be visible on outside of aircraft
    * Paper document required to be onboard
  * ==**R** - **Radio station license**==
    * International only
    * Good for 10 years?
    * *Note: the pilot may also need a radiotelephone operator permit, but that is a requirement of the pilot, not the plane as the items in this list pertain to.*
  * ==**O** - **Operating limitations**==
    * Includes but not limited to: placards, gauge markings, POH/AFM
  * ==**W** - **Weight and balance**==

# Radio Station License / Radiotelephone Operator Permit

* Regarding an additional "R" for radio station license see [FCC Commercial Radio Operator License Program](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/commercial-radio-operator-license-program), [Transport Canada: Flying to Canada: what you need to know - TP 15048](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/general-operating-flight-rules/flying-canada-what-you-need-know-tp-15048), [14 CFR &sect;87.89](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-87/subpart-C/subject-group-ECFR7723e17ce169759/section-87.89), and [14 CFR &sect;87.89](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-87/subpart-B/section-87.18).
* Basically, the *plane* needs a radio station license and the *pilot* needs a restricted radiotelephone operator permit.

  > A commercial operator license does not constitute or imply FCC authorization to transmit radio signals.
  > Before you operate any radio station, make certain that the station is licensed as required by the FCC.

* Another excerpt:

  > You need a commercial radio operator license to operate the following:
  >
  > * Aircraft radio stations, except those which operate only on very high frequencies (VHF) and do not make foreign flights.

# AFM vs POH

* Aircraft owner/information manual is *not* approved by the FAA and is not a substitute for the *approved* POH/AFM
  * The POH is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information.
  * If "POH" is used in the main title, a statement must be included on the title page indicating that sections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM.
  * The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual.
* Manuals follow standard format
* AFM vs POH/PIM
  * AFM regulated by FAA and specific to airplane
  * POH/PIM general aircraft info
  * POH is standardized by the General Aviation Manufacturer's Association
    * [GAMA Specification 1, rev 1996](https://gama.aero/documents/gama-specification-1-specification-for-pilots-operating-handbook-version-2-0/)

> The title [of the document shall be] "Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual" for all airplanes except those for which the airplane manufacturer elected to provide a separate FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual. In the latter case, the title shall be "Pilot's Operating Handbook".

> Note: After the effective date of this revision, Pilot's Operating Handbooks for newly manufactured airplanes must be FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manuals.
