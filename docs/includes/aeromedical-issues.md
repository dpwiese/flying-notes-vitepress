# Hyperventilation

* **Hyperventilation** is an increase in the rate and depth of breathing
* ==Results in inssufficient CO2 in the blood stream==
* Can happen when anxious, scared, or nervous
* Common symptoms of hyperventilation include:
  * Visual impairment
  * Unconsciousness
  * Lightheaded or dizzy sensation
  * Tingling sensations
  * Hot and cold sensations
  * Muscle spasms
* Rapid or deep breathing while using supplemental oxygen can cause hyperventilation
* Treatment by slowing breathing rate or breathing into a bag

# Middle Ear and Sinus Problems

* Free gas in body expands due to pressure difference during climb/descent
* Middle ear pressure, Eustachain tube (back of throat) allows pressure balance, normally closed except when chewing, swallowing, yawning
* Sinus problems can also affect pressure equalization
* Constantly equalize

# Spatial Disorientation

* Vestibular System (inner ear/balance) + Somatosensory System (nerves/gravity) + Visual System
* If sight or outside visual reference is lost, senses can be misleading
* Vestibular system = fluid in inner-ear makes contact with hairs, deflect
* Illusions
  * See [Vestibular and visual illusions](TODO@dpwiese)
  * Posture considerations
* ==If spatial disorientation occurs, rely on instruments==

# Motion Sickness

* Caused by continuous stimulation of the inner ear that controls sense of balance
* Brain receiving conflicting signals
* To allieviate
  * ==Fix eyes on point outside the aircraft==
  * ==Use cabin airflow==
  * Avoid sudden head movements
  * Breathe slowly

# CO Poisoning

* Colorless, odorless
* Attaches to hemoglobin easier, intercepts oxygen
* Heater element, if broken exhaust pipe

# Stress

* **Stress**
  * ==Stress is the body's response to demands placed upon it.==
  * Acute (normal, part of life)
  * Chronic (needs to be dealt with prior to flight)

# Fatigue

* **Fatigue**
  * Fatigue results in loss of focus, attention, ability to communicate, decision making process
  * ==Acute fatigue, a normal occurrence of everyday living, is the tiredness felt after long periods of physical and mental strain==
  * Chronic fatigue is not enough time to recover from repeated acute fatigue, and may have deeper points or origin e.g. financial stress
  * Deal with acute fatigue before it becomes chronic

# Dehydration

* Limit intake of diuretic drinks
