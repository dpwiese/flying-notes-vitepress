# Hyperventilation

* **Hyperventilation** is an increase in the rate and depth of breathing
* ==Results in insufficient CO2 in the blood stream==
* Can happen when anxious, scared, or nervous
* Common symptoms of hyperventilation include:
  * Visual impairment
  * Unconsciousness
  * Lightheaded or dizzy sensation
  * Tingling sensations
  * Hot and cold sensations
  * Muscle spasms
* Rapid or deep breathing while using supplemental oxygen can cause hyperventilation
* Treatment by slowing breathing rate or breathing into a bag

# Middle Ear and Sinus Problems

* Free gas in body expands due to pressure difference during climb/descent
* Middle ear pressure, Eustachain tube (back of throat) allows pressure balance, normally closed except when chewing, swallowing, yawning
* Sinus problems can also affect pressure equalization
* Constantly equalize

# Spatial Disorientation

* [FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf)
  * Chapter 3: Human Factors
    * Page 3-5: Illusions Leading to Spatial Disorientation
* Vestibular System (inner ear/balance) + Somatosensory System (nerves/gravity) + Visual System
* If sight is lost, senses can be misleading
* Vestibular system = fluid in inner-ear makes contact with hairs, deflect
* Basically all illusions below are caused by a steady-state condition being reached in the inner ear that is not straight-and-level flight
  * Return to straight-and-level flight from this condition then feels wrong causing the pilot to react incorrectly
* Spatial illusions
  * **The Leans**
    * Enter bank too slowly to detect, abrupt change is made
    * Or in a prolonged turn
  * **Coriolis Illusion**
    * Continuous turn, fluid stabilizes in a given direction
    * If pilot head turns, feels like a turn
    * Important to minimize head moments when scanning or reaching for a chart
  * **Graveyard Spiral**
    * Continuous turn, fluid stabilizes
      * When returns to level, feels like opposite banked turn so returns to original banked position
      * Pilot pulls back to compensate for loss of lift
  * **Somatographic Illusion**
    * Rapid acceleration feels like pitch up, deceleration, pitch down
  * **Inversion Illusion**
    * Kind of inverse of somatographic illusion
    * Abrupt change from climb to S&L, feel like "tumbling backwards"
  * **Elevator Illusion**
    * Abrupt vertical movement, can feel like a climb
* Visual Illusions
  * False Horizon
  * Autokinesis (stationary light appears to move)
* Posture considerations
* Optical Illusions
  * Runway width = narrow => plane high, wide => plane low
  * Runway slope = downward => plane low, upward => plane high (low appraoch)
  * Haze = further away
  * Fog = pitch up attitude
* ==**The takeaway is to rely on flight instruments**==

# Motion Sickness

* Caused by continuous stimulation of the inner ear that controls sense of balance
* Brain receiving conflicting signals
* To allieviate
  * ==Fix eyes on point outside the aircraft==
  * ==Use cabin airflow==
  * Avoid sudden head movements
  * Breathe slowly

# CO Poisoning

* Colorless, odorless
* Attaches to hemoglobin easier, intercepts oxygen
* Heater element, if broken exhaust pipe

# Stress

* **Stress**
  * ==Stress is the body's response to demands placed upon it.==
  * Acute (normal, part of life)
  * Chronic (needs to be dealt with prior to flight)

# Fatigue

* **Fatigue**
  * Fatigue results in loss of focus, attention, ability to communicate, decision making process
  * ==Acute fatigue, a normal occurrence of everyday living, is the tiredness felt after long periods of physical and mental strain==
  * Chronic fatigue is not enough time to recover from repeated acute fatigue, and may have deeper points or origin e.g. financial stress
  * Deal with acute fatigue before it becomes chronic

# Dehydration

* Limit intake of diuretic drinks
