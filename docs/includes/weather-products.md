# Weather Products

::: tip
More importantly than memorizing all of the products below, which are constantly being changed, updated, and shut down, it is important to have a general understanding of what information is needed and how to retrieve it using the available products.
:::

## Overview

* ==Aviation weather services are how we get information about the weather==
* The output of these various services and products can be catagorized as either:
  * ==Observation==
  * ==Forecast== (and outlook)
* Another catagorization of weather products is
  * ==Textual==
  * ==Graphical==
* Yet another categorization is
  * ==Surface==
  * ==Upper-air==
* We use weather products to get information about the following:
  * Want to know pressures zones (e.g. High, Low), as good/bad weather associated with high/low pressure. Also H and L imply wind direction around them, can enable flight to be planned with tailwind, for example.
  * Want to know more about pressures via isobars, as can further help indicate winds.
  * Want to know areas of poor visibility/ceilings, for determining extent to which flight can be VFR/IFR, for example.
  * Want to know freezing level, to avoid icing, for example.
  * Also want to avoid adverse conditions for safety reasons, e.g. convective activity, icing.
  * Also from winds/temps aloft can get temp lapse rate, to give another indicator of stability.

### Textual Products

![Textual products. Reference unknown.](/img/textual_products_glance.png){width=460}

* *Note: only textual products used to have letter acronyms for them.*
  * This seems to have changed with the graphical area forecast (GFA)

### Graphical Products

![Graphical products. Reference unknown.](/img/graphical_products_glance.png){width=460}

* *Note: most graphical products are observations.*
* *Note: weather products are changing all the time, so the above overview may not be current, but should give a pretty good idea of what is available.*

::: warning Ceiling
Ceiling is the lowest layer of clouds or obscuring phenomenon that is reported as "broken," "overcast," or "obscuration"
:::

* From [AIM 7−1−14 Reporting of Cloud Heights](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-14):

> a. Ceiling, by definition in the CFRs and as used in aviation weather reports and forecasts, is the height above ground (or water) level of the lowest layer of clouds or obscuring phenomenon that is reported as "broken," "overcast," or "obscuration,"

* Note: in RMK SLPXXX - 1 hPa = 1 mb, and
  * 1013 mb = 29.92 inHg
  * 1017 mb = 30.02 inHg
* From [https://www.aviationweather.ws/072_Obscured_or_Partially_Obscured_Sky.php](https://www.aviationweather.ws/072_Obscured_or_Partially_Obscured_Sky.php):

> When the sky is totally hidden by the surface based phenomena, the ceiling is the vertical visibility from the ground upward into the obscuration.

* From [AIM 7-1-29 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Weather Formats](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-29):

> Except for precipitation, phenomena located within 5 statute miles of the point of observation will be reported as at the station. Phenomena between 5 and 10 statute miles will be reported in the vicinity, "VC." Precipitation not occurring at the point of observation but within 10 statute miles is also reported as in the vicinity, "VC." Phenomena beyond 10 statute miles will be shown as distant, "DSNT." Distances are in statute miles except for automated lightning remarks which are in nautical miles.

* The descriptors `MI` (shallow), `BC` (patches) and `PR` (partial) are used only in combination with the letter abbreviation `FG` (fog), e.g. `MIFG`.
* The descriptors `DR` (drifting) and `BL` (blowing) are used only in combination with `SN` (snow), `DU` (dust) and `SA` (sand).
* Drifting is used if the snow, dust or sand is raised less than two metres above ground; if two metres or more, blowing is used.
* If blowing snow (`BLSN`) and snow (`SN`) are occurring together, both are reported but in separate w'w' groups, e.g. `SN BLSN`.
* `SH` (shower) is used only in combination with precipitation types `RA` (rain), `SN` (snow), `PE` (ice pellets), `GR` (hail) and `GS` (snow pellets) if occurring at the time of observation, e.g. `SHPE` or `-SHRAGR`.
* `TS` (thunderstorm) is either reported alone or in combination with one or more of the precipitation types. The end of a thunderstorm is the time at which the last thunder was heard, followed by a 15-minute period with no further thunder.
* (Note: `TS` and `SH` are not used together, since w'w' groups can have only one descriptor.)
* `FZ` (freezing) is used only in combination with the weather types `DZ` (drizzle), `RA` (rain) and `FG` (fog).

## PIREP

* **PIREP (UA)** - Pilot report of observed weather conditions.
* Pilots are pretty good about reporting icing and turbulence
* Good idea when checking in with a controller to state how the ride is
  * "Approach Cessna 12345 level 8,000 light chop"
* Most accurate weather report
* When reading a PIREP, each piece of information is within the forward slashes
* Required info for PIREP: location, time, altitude MSL, type of aircraft, weather encountered.

**PIREP icing reporting levels**

See: [AIM 7-1-19 PIREPs Relating to Airframe Icing](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-19).

1. **Trace Icing**
    * Ice becomes noticeable or perceiptible
    * The rate of accumulation is slightly greater than the rate of sublimation
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is less than 1/4 inch (6 mm) per hour on the outer wing
    * The pilot should consider exiting the icing conditions before they become worse
2. **Light Icing**
    * The rate of ice accumulation requires occasional cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is 1/4 inch to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing
    * The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition.
    * Problem if flight is prolonged more than one hour, no problem if anti-icing equipment used
3. **Moderate Icing**
    * The rate of ice accumulation requires frequent cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing
    * The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition as soon as possible.
    * Short encounters are potentially hazardous; anti-icing or diversion is necessary
4. **Severe Icing**
    * The rate of ice accumulation is such that ice protection systems fail to remove the accumulation of ice and ice accumulates in locations not normally prone to icing, such as areas aft of protected surfaces and any other areas identified by the manufacturer
    * A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is more than 3 inches (7.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing
    * By regulation, immediate exit is required
    * De/anti-icing insufficient to deal with hazard; need immediate diversion

**PIREP turbulence reporting levels**

See: [AIM 7-1-21 PIREPs Relating to Turbulence](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-21).

* **Light**
  * *Momentary* without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude
  * *Note: keyword is momentary*
* **Moderate**
  * Variations in indicated airspeed
* **Severe**
  * Aircraft may be momentarily out of control
* **Extreme**
  * Impossible to control
* **Chop**
  * Rhythmic bumpiness without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude

![[AIM Table 7-1-8 Turbulence Reporting Criteria Table](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html)](/img/turbulence_intensities.png){width=460}

## Freezing Level Charts

* See Aviation Weather Center [Current Freezing Level Forecast](https://www.aviationweather.gov/icing/frzlvl)
* Shows forecast freezing level in 100s of feet MSL for a given forecast window
  * It shows the current freezing level
  * Also shows forecast in windows of 1 hour up to 18 hours out

![Freezing level chart. Aviation Weather Center [Current Freezing Level Forecast](https://www.aviationweather.gov/icing/frzlvl)](/img/awc-freezing-level-chart.jpg){width=440}

## Stability Charts

* This used to be the lifted index chart which is no longer produced

## Severe Weather Outlook Charts

* See NOAA's National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center [Convective Outlook Chart](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/)

## TAF

* Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)
* ==Covers five statute mile radius around an airport==
* ==Each TAF is valid for a 24 or 30-hour time period and is updated four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z==
  * 30 hour TAFs are usually at airports that serve long-range aircraft, so they can get their TAFs in more advance before taking off
* Some common
  * `NSW` - No significant weather
  * `SKC` - Sky clear
  * `SLP` - Sea level pressure
  * `TEMPO` - Last for less than an hour and occur during less than half of the time period specified

## Area Forecast

* Area Forecast (FA)
* [aviationweather.gov](https://www.aviationweather.gov) has discontinued textual area forecasts, but it seems they are still on FAA exams
* See
  * [https://www.aviationweather.gov/areafcst/help](https://www.aviationweather.gov/areafcst/help)
* The FA gives a picture of clouds, general weather conditions, and visual meteorological conditions (VMC) expected over a large area encompassing several states.
* There are six areas for which area forecasts are published in the contiguous 48 states.
* Area forecasts are issued three times a day and are valid for 18 hours.
* Note the difference in valid time of 12 hours for the *forecast* and an additional 6 for the categorical *outlook*
  * I'm not really sure exactly the difference between these two
  * On the FAA exam, they will try to trick based on these two things
* From [https://www.aviationweather.gov/areafcst](https://www.aviationweather.gov/areafcst):

  > THE TEXT AREA FORECAST FOR THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. TO GET THE FORECAST FOR THESE AREAS CHECK THE GFA TOOL.

## Graphical Forecast for Aviation

* Graphical Forecast for Aviation (GFA)
* See [Aviation Weather Center Graphical Forecast for Aviation](https://www.aviationweather.gov/gfa)
* To replace the textual area forecast (FA)
* Gives a brief summary of the location and movement of fronts, pressure systems, and circulation patterns
* The *forecast* is valid for 12 hours with an additional 6 hours categorical *outlook*

![Graphical forecast for aviation. [https://www.aviationweather.gov/gfa](https://www.aviationweather.gov/gfa)](/img/gfa.jpg){width=560}

* Can select
  * Region
  * Forecast time
* Dots represent types of significant weather
  * e.g. 2 dots = light rain
  * See: [Weather Symbols](https://www.aviationweather.gov/metar/symbol) or figure below
* Red wind barb means gusting

## Winds and Temperatures Aloft

### Textual

* Winds and Temperatures Aloft Forecast - Textual (FD)
* See also the graphical version Winds and Temperatures Aloft Forecast - Graphical (FB)
* See Aviation Weather Center's [Winds/Temps Data](https://aviationweather.gov/windtemp)
* Winds and temps aloft are *forecasts* based on observations made a few hours prior
* Made twice a day based on the radiosonde upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z
* Format `DDSSTT` where
  * `D` is wind direction
  * `S` is wind speed
  * `T` is temperature
* Example `2321-04` is wind from 230 at 21 knots and temperature -21 &#176;C
* ==No temp is given for 3,000 ft MSL or when 2,500 ft AGL==
* ==Above 24,000 feet all temperatures are negative so minus sign is dropped==
* Wind `9900` means light and variable (less than 5 kts)
* For winds greater than 99 knots, add `50` to the `DD` and subtract 100 from the wind speed to get `SS` values
  * Example: `7545` means winds of 145 knots from 250

### Graphical

* Winds and Temperatures Aloft Forecast - Graphical (FB)
  * See Aviation Weather Center [Winds/Temps Plots](https://aviationweather.gov/windtemp)

## Surface Analysis Chart

## Weather Depiction Chart

From [FAA-AC-00-45H Aviation Weather Services](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1030235):

> The Weather Depiction Chart is being phased out by the NWS, in favor of newer ceiling and visibility products, like the CVA product.

* However, CVA product seems to have died, or never existed
* A weather depiction chart details surface conditions as derived from METAR and other surface observations.
* Shows areas where conditions are reported above or below VFR weather minimums
* Observation
* Every 3 hours

![Weather depiction chart. The chart is no longer available at this link: [https://www.aviationweather.gov/briefing](https://www.aviationweather.gov/briefing)](/img/weather_depiction_2.gif){width=540}

## Prognostic Chart

* See: [Prog Charts](https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/#progchart)
* Map displaying weather forecast.
* Forecast - up to 7 days for surface
* Surface charts show pressure systems and fronts.
* Significant weather charts (surface level, low level, mid level, high level) show:
  * Ceiling and visibility
  * Turbulence
  * Freezing levels
* One of the best uses of a low-level prognostic chart is determining areas to avoid
* *Note: areas of continuous rain are hatched in but I can't find the legend for that anywhere.*
* Example `**` means light snow (see GFA legend above)

## Constant Pressure Analysis

* Gives
  * Wind
  * Observed temperature
  * Temperature/dew point spread
* For a flight at 10,000 MSL use the 700 mb chart
  * This can be figured out roughly by remembering the standard sea level pressure corresponding to 29.92 inHg is 1013.2 mb and using the resulting lapse rate of 33.9 mb per 1000 ft. to get about 700 mb
* It is for "flight levels" because it is at constant pressure levels rather than constant altitude?

## Appendix

* *All local barometric pressure readings are converted to a sea level pressure*.
  * At an airport at elevation with altimeter setting of 29.92 needs to cause altimeter to read field elevation, as does an airport at sea level with altimeter of 29.92. Thus in these two cases *the same altimeter setting corresponds to a different barometric pressure at the field*.
  * *To achieve this, each station converts its barometric pressure by adding approximately 1 inHg for every 1,000 feet of elevation.*
* ==***Wind directions on weather observations based on true north.***==
* Wind direction is reported by the direction *from which it originates*
* All charts and textual sources (METAR, TAF, winds aloft, surface analysis charts, etc) use true north as the reference.
* ATIS/AWOS/ASOS broadcasts, or any information a controller gives you over the radio, is magnetic.
* From [AIM 7–1–10 Weather Observing Programs](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-10):

  > Wind direction broadcast over FAA radios is in reference to magnetic north.

::: tip
The general rule regarding weather reported winds are referenced to true or magnetic direction is: if you read it, it's true. If you hear it, it's magnetic.

* Basic definitions used across the different products
  * ==**LIFR**: Low IFR - ceiling less than 500ft and/or visibility less than 1 mile==
  * ==**IFR**: Ceiling 500 to less than 1,000ft and/or visibility 1 to less than 3 miles==
  * ==**MVFR**: Marginal VFR - ceiling 1,000 to 3,000ft and/or visibility 3 to 5 miles==
  * ==**VFR**: Ceiling greater than 3,000ft and visibility greater than 5 miles, sky clear==
  * **Ceiling** is the lowest layer of clouds reported as being *broken or overcast*
    * or the vertical visibility into an obscuration like fog or haze
  * **Visibility** is the greatest horizontal distance at which prominent objects can be viewed with the naked eye
