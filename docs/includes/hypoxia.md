# Hypoxia

::: warning Hypoxia
Not enough oxygen.
:::

* The forms of hypoxia are based on their causes:
  * **Hypoxic hypoxia**
    * ==Insufficient oxygen available to the body as a whole==
    * E.g.: blocked airway, drowning
    * The "normal" hypoxia we talk about in aviation
    * Usually caused by the decreased pressure of oxygen at altitude
  * **Anemic** or **Hypemic hypoxia**
    * ==Occurs when the blood is not able to take up and transport a sufficient amount of oxygen to the cells in the body==
    * May be due to low blood supply, low hemoglobin, or CO poisoning
    * Same symptoms as hypoxic hypoxia
  * **Stagnant hypoxia**
    * ==Blood not flowing to tissues that need it==
    * Also known as ischemia
    * Can occur with excessive acceleration of gravity (Gs).
    * Also from cold temperatures reducing circulation
  * **Histotoxic hypoxia**
    * ==The inability of the cells to effectively use oxygen==
    * This impairment of cellular respiration can be caused by alcohol and drugs
* Symptoms of hypoxia
  * Belligerence
  * Euphoria
  * Headache
  * Decreased response to stimuli and increased reaction time
  * Impaired judgment
  * Visual impairment
  * Drowsiness
  * Lightheaded or dizzy sensation
  * Tingling in fingers and toes
  * Numbness
  * False sense of security
  * Blue colored lips and fingernails
  * Tunnel vision
* Symptoms can take effect at 5,000 ft. at night
* Immediately reduce altitude, use oxygen, avoid alcohol
