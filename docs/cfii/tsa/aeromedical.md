# Aeromedical Factors

This page covers *Task B. Aeromedical Factors* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

* Colorless, odorless
* Attaches to hemoglobin easier, intercepts oxygen
* Heater element, if broken exhaust pipe

## Evolved Gases From Scuba Diving

* SCUBA Considerations (Induced Decompression Sickness)
* Experience low barometric pressures => Nitrogen comes out of physical solution and forms bubbles
* SCUBA, wait 24 hours if flying above 8,000'. Below 8,000 ft., 12 hours
* After diving *where a controlled ascent was not required* wait at least 12 hours before flying to *flight altitudes* (not cabin altituddes) of 8,000 ft. MSL or less
* After diving *where a controlled ascent was required* wait at least 24 hours before flying to 8,000 ft. MSL or less

## Stress and Fatigue

* Stress
  * Acute (normal, part of life)
  * Chronic (needs to be dealt with prior to flight)
* Fatigue
  * Fatigue => loss of focus, attention, ability to communicate, decision making process
  * Acute = stress, sleep deprivation
  * Chronic = result of dealing with acute fatigue factors day in and out
  * Deal with acute fatigue before it becomes chronic
