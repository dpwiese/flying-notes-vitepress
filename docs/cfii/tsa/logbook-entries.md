# Logbook Entries

This page covers *Task D. Logbook Entries Related to Instrument Instruction* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Logbook Entries or Training Records for Instrument Flight / Instruction

* [14 CFR &sect;61.51 Pilot logbooks](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51) requires pilots to log training time and aeronautical experience used to meet the requirements for an instrument rating and the recent flight experience required by [14 CFR &sect;61.57 Recent flight experience: Pilot in command](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57)
* *In actual instrument conditions* there is no way for two *pilots* to both log PIC time
  * Per [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e)) only someone with an instrument rating can *act as PIC* in weather less than VFR.
    * However, just like someone in simulated instrument conditions that is the sole manipulator of the flight controls can *log PIC time* while their safety pilot is the *acting PIC* the same applies to actual instrument conditions.
    * The difference in actual IMC though is that the acting PIC *cannot log PIC* while the non-instrument rated pilot is the sole manipulator of the flight controls (and therefore logging PIC)
    * See
      * [Walker Legal Interpretation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2011/Walker_2011_Legal_Interpretation.pdf)
      * [Speranza Legal Interpretation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2009/Speranza_2009_Legal_Interpretation.pdf)
* *In simulated instrument conditions* both pilots can *log* PIC time when the pilot (under foggles) is the sole manipulator of the flight controls
  * The agreement here is that the instructor as safety pilot is acting as PIC, and the pilot is the sole manipulator of the flight controls
  * And by [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)) the safety pilot is a required crewmember, so they get to log PIC time
  * See also [14 CFR &sect;91.109](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.109)
* Instrument flight time (simulated or actual) can be logged when the pilot operates aircraft solely by reference to instruments
* A student pilot *cannot log* PIC time whether under foggles or not, because the sole manipulator of the flight controls requires the pilot be rated for the aircraft they are flying, which a student pilot is not
* Safety pilot needs to have valid medical or BasicMed
  * Essentially, they have to be legal enough to operate the aircraft themselves with a passenger
* ==CFII can log PIC time regardless of meteorological conditions when acting as as instructor==
  * See [14 CFR &sect;61.51(e)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(e)(3))
* Logging approaches
  * **When can a** ***pilot*** **log an instrument approach in IMC? When under foggles?**
    * Actual past FAF
    * Simulated all the way down to minimums
  * **When can a** ***CFII*** **log an instrument approach?**
    * A flight instructor may log an IAP conducted by the student in actual IMC
      * See FAA letter to Levy, 2008

### Endorsements

* Instrument knowledge or practical test
* Knowledge test deficiency review and 3 hours flight training in the 2 calendar months before practical test
* Endorsement to retest after failure (either knowledge or practical)
* Keep date, name of student, test, and result for 3 years
* Note: put flight reviews and IPCs in IACRA

## Preparation of a Recommendation for an Instrument Rating Practical Test

* Requirements under Part 61 are in [14 CFR &sect;61.65 Instrument rating requirements](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-B/section-61.65)
* [FAA-AC-61-65H Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1034129) gives the two required endorsements
  * One says the pilot has received the required training and is ready to take the test
  * The other says the pilot has received the required training within 2 months of the practical test, and that we have reviewed deficiencies on knowledge test
* Requirements under 141
  * 35 hours of flight training instrument time
    * Includes 14 training device hours

## Required Logbook Endorsement for Satisfactory Completion of an IPC {#ipc-required-logbook-endorsement}

* [FAA-AC-61-65H Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1034129) gives the required endorsement upon satisfactory completion of an IPC
  * No logbook entry reflecting unsatisfactory performance is required - just log it as dual given
  * [FAA-AC-61-98D Currency Requirements and Guidance for the Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentid/1033391)
  * See also Instrument ACS for IPC requirements

### IPC Overview

The flight instructor determines that the pilot has adequate knowledge and understanding of the following areas:

1. Instrument en route and approach chart interpretation
    * Standard Instrument Departures (SID)
    * Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP)
    * Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STAR)
    * Area Navigation (RNAV) / Global Positioning System (GPS) / wide area augmentation system (WAAS) procedures
2. Obtaining and analyzing weather information
    * Including knowledge of hazardous weather phenomena, such as icing and convective activity.
3. Preflight planning, including
    * Aircraft performance
    * Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) information (including temporary flight restrictions (TFR))
    * Fuel requirements
    * Alternate requirements
    * Use of appropriate FAA publications such as the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD)
4. Aircraft systems related to IFR operations, including appropriate operating methods, limitations, and emergency procedures due to equipment failure.
5. Aircraft flight instruments and navigation equipment, including characteristics, limitations, operating techniques, and emergency procedures due to malfunction or failure, such as lost communications and automation failure procedures.
6. Determining the airworthiness of the aircraft for instrument flight, including required inspections and documents.
7. Air traffic control (ATC) procedures pertinent to flight under IFR, with emphasis on elements of ATC clearances and pilot/controller responsibilities.
8. A general working knowledge of aerodynamic principles relating to angle of attack (AOA) and the purpose, operation, and limitations of AOA indicators (if installed).
