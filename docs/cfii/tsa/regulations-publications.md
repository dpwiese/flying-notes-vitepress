### Instrument Rating Privileges

* **==Flight under IFR or in weather less than VFR in controlled airspace==**
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.3(e) Instrument rating](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3#p-61.3(e))
    * *"No person may act as pilot in command of a civil aircraft under IFR or in weather conditions less than the minimums prescribed for VFR flight unless that person holds ... instrument rating on that person's pilot certificate."*
  * Really this is flight in weather less than VMC in *any* airspace, as operations in uncontrolled airspace under IMC without a clearance or instrument rating violate [14 CFR &sect;91.13 Careless or reckless operation](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-A/section-91.13)
* **==Flight in Class A airspace==**
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.135 Operations in Class A airspace](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.135)
    * *"Each person operating an aircraft in Class A airspace must conduct that operation under instrument flight rules (IFR)."*
* **==Passengers for hire on cross countries longer than 50 nm or at night==**
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.133 Commercial pilot privileges and limitations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-F/section-61.133)
    * *"The carriage of passengers for hire in airplanes on cross-country flights in excess of 50 nautical miles* ***or*** *at night is prohibited."*
* **==Special VFR at night==**
  * Technically it is between sunset and sunrise
  * [14 CFR &sect;91.157(b)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.157#p-91.157(b)(4))
    * *"The person being granted the ATC clearance meets the applicable requirements for* ***instrument flight*** *under part 61 of this chapter."*

## Practical Test Standards

* [Practical Test Standards (PTS)](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_standards)
  * Older version of testing standards.
  * The PTS primarily provides metrics to define acceptable performance of the "flight proficiency" skills listed in 14 CFR part 61 for a given certificate or rating.
* [Airman Certification Standards (ACS)](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs)
  * The ACS is an enhanced version of the Practical Test Standards (PTS) that started replacing the PTS in 2016, and will eventually replace all PTS.
  * It adds task-specific knowledge and risk management elements to each PTS Area of Operation and Task.
  * The result is a comprehensive presentation that integrates the standards for what an applicant needs to know, consider, and do in order to pass both the knowledge test and the practical test for a certificate or rating.
