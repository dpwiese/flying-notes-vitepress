# Intercepting, Tracking, and DME Arcs

This page covers *Task A. Intercepting and Tracking Navigational Systems and DME Arcs* from the [FAA-S-8081-9E Flight Instructor Instrument Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_instrument_pts_9.pdf).

## Purpose

Use ground-based navigation systems to perform en-route navigation, and perform proper procedure to fly a DME arc.

## Elements

* Normal VOR is 10&#176; full-scale deflection from center to either side
* ==Cardinal rule: always want FROM indication unless flying directly TO the station==
  * Want OBS in agreement with heading
* If plane has HSI, keep the top of CDI needle on the lubber line to intercept
* On planes without HSI
  * Full needle deflection use 45&#176; intercept angle
  * Partial needle deflection use 30&#176; intercept angle

### DME Arcs

* A series of straight lines to approximate a circle
* Begin turn to join 0.7 nm prior to desired DME distance
* Turn 110&#176; if approaching from inside the arc and 70&#176; if approaching from outside the arc
* When DME hits proper arc distance turn 20&#176; toward VOR
  * Repeat until crossing the lead radial
  * If no lead radial, begin turn to exit arc 5&#176; prior to desired radial
