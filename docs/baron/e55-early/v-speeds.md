# V-Speeds

* The POH on page 1-5 and page 3-3 does say that all airspeeds in the POH are in IAS unless otherwise noted.
* Page 3-3 also says emergency airspeeds were derived at 5300 lb (max takeoff/landing weight) as well as those airspeeds presented on page 4-3.
* **E55 Baron V-speeds (KIAS)**
  * $V_{\text{SO}}$ = 73
  * $V_{\text{S}}$ = 83
  * $V_{\text{MCA}}$ = 80
  * $V_{\text{R}}$ = 84
