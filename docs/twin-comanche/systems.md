## Propellor

* From service manual:

  > Propellers are Hartzell full feathering, constant speed, each conaolled by a pvernor mounted on the englne supplying oil through the propeller shaft at various pressures. Oil pressure from the governor moves the blades into low pitch (high RPM). The centrifugal twisting moment of the blades also tends to move the blades into low pitch. Opposing these two forces is a force produced by compressed air between the cylinder head and the piston which tends to move the blades into high pitch in the absence of governor oil pressure. Thus, feathering is accomplished by compressed air.

## Flaps

* From the POH:

  > Installed on the Twin Comanche are electrically operated fowler flaps which can be lowered and stopped at any position up to 27 degrees.

## Glide Ratio

* From the POH:

  > Both-engines-out glide ratio for the Twin Comanche with landing gear and flaps retracted and propellers windmilling is 10 to 1, or approximately two miles of gliding distance for each 1,000 feet of altitude above the terrain. Drag is substantially reduced when the propellers are feathered, and glide ratio improves to 13 to 1. When the landing gear is extended, drag is increased and glide ratio is radically reduced to approximately 7 to 1. For this reason, it is suggested that the landing gear and flaps not be extended in most engine-out emergencies until over the threshold of the landing area. Landing gear down operating time is approximately 7 seconds.
