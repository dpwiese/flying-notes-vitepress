## Teaching

1. Preparation of a lesson
    * Steps of teaching process (**PPAR**)
        * **Preparation**
        * **Presentation**
            * Demonstrator / performance method - instructor demonstrates, learner attempts
            * Lecture method
        * **Application**
            * Learner does it themselves
        * **Review/Evaluation/Assessment**
            * Should be an integral part of each lesson
            * Should be based on objectives and goals established in lesson plan
2. Organization of material
    * Instructors job is to help student learn, make associations and gain insight
    * Lessons should be sequenced to help learner achieve desired outcome
    * Show relationships between main points that will be presented in the lesson
    * Parts of lesson introduction (**AMO**)
        * **Attention** - about focusing learner on new subject
        * **Motivation** - show need for new motivation
        * **Overview** - what will be covered
3. Training delivery methods (**LGD CDC**)
    a. **Lecture method**
        * Most economical in terms of time
        * Effective at showing relationships between theory and practice
        * Teaching leacture - needs keen perception on part of instructor to determine of learner is actually learning the material
        * Lecture methods
            * Reading material
            * Illustrated talk (visual aids)
            * Briefing (concise facts, no elaboration)
            * Teaching/formal (inform, persuade, entertain)
                * Little to no participation from learner
        * First establish desired objective and outcome
        * **Informal lecture**
            * Has learner participation
            * Participation best encouraged with questions
            * Set tone with friendly and relaxed atmosphere so people feel comfortable to participate
    b. **Guided discussion method**
        * Lead with leadoff overhead question (usually begin with how? or why?)
        * Learner level of topic knowledge
        * Learning is achieved through the skillful use of questions
        * Guided discussion questions (**ORDRR**)
            * **Overhead**
                * Directed toward the entire class rather than an individual learner
                * Does not require a specific answer
                * Centers the thoughts of the entire class around the subject being taught
            * **Rhetorical**
                * Asked for a purpose other than to obtain the information the question asks
                * Asked to stimulate group thought
                * Normally answered by the instructor, it is more commonly used in lecturing rather than in guided discussions
            * **Direct**
                * A question used for follow-up purposes, but directed at a specific individual.
            * **Reverse**
                * Used in response to a learner's question
                * Rather than give a direct answer to the learner's query, the instructor returns the question to the same individual to provide the answer.
            * **Relay**
                * Used in response to a learner's question, the question is redirected to another individual.
    c. **Demonstration-performance method**
        * Students learn by trying under supervision
        * Include description of skill, conditions, and standards with which it needs to be complete
        * Five essential steps (**EDLIE**)
            * **Explanation**
            * **Demonstration**
            * **Learner (or student) performance**
            * **Instructor supervision**
            * **Evaluation**
    d. **Computer-assisted learning method**
        * One advantage less time is spent on traditional ground school and can spend more time on integration and correlation of learning
        * It's self paced
        * Interactive and can respond to learner inputs
    e. **Drill and practice method**
    f. **Cooperative / Group Learning**
        * Heterogeneous groups
        * Greater interaction and achievement
        * Greater success of learners than if they learn alone
        * Instructor gives instructions and then lets learners interact
4. Problem based learning
5. Instruction aids and training technologies
    * Instructional aids
        * Devices to assist you and learner in the process
        * Cover key points
        * Support point in lesson and lesson objective
